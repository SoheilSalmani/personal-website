1. Create a document in LaTeX and compile it using the CLI.

   <Solution>

   ```latex fp=document.tex nu
   \documentclass[a4paper, 11pt]{article}

   \title{My Document}
   \author{Soheil Salmani}
   \date{January 1, 2022}

   \begin{document}
   \maketitle
   \section{What's this?}
   This is our second document. It contains a title and a section with text.
   \end{document}
   ```

   ```sh
   latex --output-format=pdf document.tex
   ```

   </Solution>

2. Describe the structure of a LaTeX document.

   <Solution>

   A LaTeX document is based on a versatile template called a **class**. It
   provides customizable features, usually built for a certain purpose.

   This first part of the document is called the **preamble** of the document.
   This is where we choose the class, specify properties, and in general make
   document-wide definitions.

   `\begin{document}` marks the end of the preamble and the beginning of the
   actual document. `\end{document}` marks the end of the document. Everything
   that follows would be ignored by LaTeX. Generally, such a piece of code
   that's framed by a `\begin` and `\end` command pair is called an
   **environment**.

   </Solution>

3. Describe how LaTeX commands work.

   <Solution>

   LaTeX **commands** begin with a backslash, followed by big or small letters,
   and are usually named in a descriptive way.

   Commands can have **parameters**, that is, options that determine in which
   way the command does its work. The values that we hand over as parameters are
   called **arguments**. They are given in curly braces or square brackets.

   ```latex
   \command
   ```

   ```latex
   \command{argument}
   ```

   ```latex
   \command[optional argument]{argument}
   ```

   There could be several arguments, each of them in braces or brackets.

   Most LaTeX commands, including those we define ourselves, consist of other
   commands. That's why LaTeX commands are also called **macros**, and the terms
   _macro_ and _command_ are used interchangeably. A command or macro that
   doesn't print something but just changes current settings, such as the font
   shape or text alignment, is also called a **declaration**.

   </Solution>

4. Describe the syntax of environments.

   <Solution>

   LaTeX environments start with `\begin` and end with `\end`. Both commands
   require the name of the environment as their argument.

   ```latex
   \begin{name}
     ...
   \end{name}
   ```

   ```latex
   \begin{name}{argument}
     ...
   \end{name}
   ```

   ```latex
   \begin{name}[optional argument]{argument}
     ...
   \end{name}
   ```

   Such environments can be used for each declaration called `\name`.

   Environments are like declarations with a built-in scope. With `\begin`, the
   environment introduces a change in layout, font, or other properties. There
   must be an `\end` command, where this change will be canceled.
