1. Create a new GCP project and generate a keyfile to be used by dbt. Test the
   following query in BigQuery.

   ```sql nu
   with customers as (

       select
           id as customer_id,
           first_name,
           last_name

       from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.customers

   ),

   orders as (

       select
           id as order_id,
           user_id as customer_id,
           order_date,
           status

       from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders

   ),

   customer_orders as (

       select
           customer_id,

           min(order_date) as first_order_date,
           max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
           count(order_id) as number_of_orders

       from orders

       group by 1

   ),

   final as (

       select
           customers.customer_id,
           customers.first_name,
           customers.last_name,
           customer_orders.first_order_date,
           customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
           coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

       from customers

       left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

   )

   select * from final
   ```

   <Solution>

   Create a service account named `dbt-user` and give it the "BigQuery User"
   role.

   </Solution>

2. In dbt Cloud, create a new dbt repository and name it `dbt-tutorial`. Then
   initialize the starter project, name the dbt project `jaffle_shop`, and run
   it. Finally, make a commit through the IDE.

   <Solution>

   ```yml fp=dbt_project.yml hl=1,6
   name: "jaffle_shop"

   # ...

   models:
     jaffle_shop:
       # ...
   ```

   </Solution>

3. Same but this time using the dbt CLI and GitHub.

   <Solution>

   ```sh
   dbt --version
   dbt init dbt-tutorial
   cd dbt-tutorial
   ```

   ```yml fp=dbt_project.yml hl=1,5,10
   name: "jaffle_shop"

   # ...

   profile: jaffle_shop

   # ...

   models:
     jaffle_shop:
       # ...
   ```

   ```yml fp=~/.dbt/profiles.yml nu
   jaffle_shop:
     target: dev
     outputs:
       dev:
         type: bigquery
         method: service-account
         keyfile: <keyfile-path>
         project: <project-id>
         dataset: dbt_soheil
         threads: 1
         timeout_seconds: 300
         location: US
         priority: interactive
   ```

   ```sh
   dbt debug
   dbt run
   ```

   </Solution>

4. Create a branch named `add-customers-model`. Add the `customers.sql` model,
   and run dbt.

5. How can I see the SQL that dbt is running?

   <Solution>

   To check out the SQL that dbt is running, you can look in:

   - dbt Cloud:
     - Within the run output, click on a model name, and then select "Details"
   - dbt CLI:
     - The `target/compiled/` directory for compiled `select` statements
     - The `target/run/` directory for compiled `create` statements
     - The `logs/dbt.log` file for verbose logging.

   </Solution>

6. How did dbt choose which schema to build my models in?

   <Solution>

   By default, dbt builds models in your target schema. To change your target
   schema:

   - If you're developing in **dbt Cloud**, these are set for each user when you
     first use a development environment.
   - If you're developing with the **dbt CLI**, this is the `schema:` parameter
     in your `profiles.yml` file.

   </Solution>

7. Update the materialization of some models. Then, delete the example models.

   <Solution>

   ```yml fp=dbt_project.yml
   models:
     jaffle_shop:
       +materialized: table
       example:
         +materialized: view
   ```

   ```sh
   dbt run
   ```

   ```sql fp=models/customers.sql nu
   {{
     config(
       materialized='view'
     )
   }}

   with customers as (

       select
           id as customer_id
           ...

   )
   ```

   ```sh
   dbt run
   dbt run --full-refresh # BigQuery
   ```

   </Solution>

8. What other model configurations are there?

   <Solution>

   You can also configure:

   - tags to support easy categorization and graph selection
   - custom schemas to split your models across multiple schemas
   - aliases if your view/table name should differ from the filename
   - snippets of SQL to run at the start or end of a model, known as hooks
   - warehouse-specific configurations for performance (e.g. `sort` and `dist`
     keys on Redshift, `partitions` on BigQuery)

   </Solution>

9. Refactor your code to have three dbt models.

   <Solution>

   ```sql fp=models/stg_orders.sql nu
   select
       id as order_id,
       user_id as customer_id,
       order_date,
       status

   from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders
   ```

   ```sql fp=models/staging/stg_customers.sql nu
   select
       id as customer_id,
       first_name,
       last_name

   from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.customers
   ```

   ```sql fp=models/customers.sql nu hl=3,9
   with customers as (

       select * from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}

   ),

   orders as (

       select * from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}

   ),

   customer_orders as (

       select
           customer_id,

           min(order_date) as first_order_date,
           max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
           count(order_id) as number_of_orders

       from orders

       group by 1

   ),

   final as (

       select
           customers.customer_id,
           customers.first_name,
           customers.last_name,
           customer_orders.first_order_date,
           customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
           coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

       from customers

       left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

   )

   select * from final
   ```

   ```yml fp=dbt_project.yml hl=4..5
   models:
     jaffle_shop:
       +materialized: table
       staging:
         +materialized: view
   ```

   </Solution>

10. How to select resources to build?

    <Solution>

    To select resources to build, use the `--select` flag (or `-s` flag):

    ```sh
    dbt run --select +customers --exclude customers
    dbt run -s staging.*
    ```

    </Solution>
