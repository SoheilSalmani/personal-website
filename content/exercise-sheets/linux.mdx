1. Why a file system relies on an _index_?

   <Solution>

   A file system uses an index to provide the appearance of an organized set of
   directories and files within a single disk division known as a _partition_.

   All the files in a disk partition are kept in directories beneath the root
   directory. The way these directories are arranged is largely governed by the
   UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

   </Solution>

2. What is the most commonly used Linux file system?

   <Solution>

   The most commonly used Linux file system is ext4.

   </Solution>

3. Describe the top-level directories.

   <Solution>

   Top-level directories—those directories located directly beneath the
   root—include `/etc/`, which contains configuration files that define the way
   individual programs and services function, and `/var/`, which contains
   _variable_ files belonging to the system or individual applications whose
   content changes frequently through the course of normal system activities.
   You’ll also want to know about the `/home/` directory where individual users
   are given directories for their private files.

   </Solution>

4. Test the `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `cat` and `less` commands.

   <Solution>

   The `l` flag (_l_ stands for _long_) lists not only the object names, but
   their file permissions, owner, group, file size, and time stamp.

   ```sh
   ls -l /var
   ls -lh /var
   ls -R /etc
   pwd
   cd /home
   cat /etc/fstab
   less /etc/group
   ```

   Test `less` with following keys: `PgUp`, `PgDn`, `Space`, `Enter` and `q`.

   **Note:** The name _cat_ is actually short for _concatenate_, which reflects
   the tool’s value in joining multiple strings or files into a single text
   stream.

   </Solution>

5. What is a shell?

   <Solution>

   Bash is probably the most popular UNIX shell. A _shell_ is any user interface
   that interprets a user’s commands. You can think of a shell as a software
   layer meant to execute all appropriately formatted commands using the
   underlying kernel and hardware system resources.

   </Solution>

6. Test the `touch`, `nano` and `vi` commands,

   <Solution>

   ```sh
   touch myfile
   nano myfile
   vi myfile
   ```

   “Touching” an existing file with `touch` updates its time stamp without
   making any changes.

   </Solution>

7. What is an inode? Test the `stat` command.

   <Solution>

   Every object within a Linux file system is represented by a unique collection
   of metadata called an _inode_. The file system index is built from the
   metadata associated with all the many inodes on a drive. To display more
   information about a file, including inode information, you can use the `stat`
   command:

   ```sh
   stat myfile
   ```

   The output includes data describing the file’s name, attributes, and time
   stamps. But it also tells you its inode ID number. It’s important to be aware
   that when you move, copy, or delete a file or directory, all you’re really
   doing is editing its inode attributes, not its ID. An _inode_, by the way, is
   an object used by UNIX systems to identify the disk location and attributes
   of files within a file system. Usually there’ll be exactly one inode for each
   file or directory.

   </Solution>

8. Test the `mkdir`, `rm` and `rmdir` commands.

   <Solution>

   ```sh
   mkdir myplace
   cd myplace
   touch newfile
   cd ..
   rmdir myplace
   ```

   ```sh
   rm -r myplace
   ```

   </Solution>

9. Test the `cp` and `mv` commands. Experiment file globbing.

   <Solution>

   ```sh
   touch file1 file2 file3 file15
   mkdir newdir
   cp file1 newdir
   mv file* newdir
   ```

   ```sh
   touch file1 file2 file3 file15
   mkdir newdir
   mv file? newdir
   ```

   </Solution>

10. What is a pseudo file?

    <Solution>

    A normal file is a collection of data that can be reliably accessed over and
    over again, even after a system reboot. By contrast, the contents of a Linux
    pseudo (or virtual) file, like those that might exist in the `/sys/` and
    `/proc/` directories, don’t really exist in the normal sense. A pseudo
    file’s contents are dynamically generated by the OS itself to represent
    specific values.

    </Solution>

11. Check the number of bytes on the disk

    <Solution>

    ```sh
    cat /sys/block/sda/size
    ```

    </Solution>

12. Explain `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, etc.

    <Solution>

    If the first storage device on a system is called `/dev/sda`, then, as you
    might guess, the second one would be called `/dev/sdb` and the third,
    `/dev/sdc`. Originally, _sda_ probably stood for SCSI Device A, but I find
    that thinking of it as Storage Device A makes it more meaningful. You might
    also run into device designations like `/dev/hda` (hard drive), `/dev/sr0`
    (DVD drive), `/dev/cdrom` (that’s right, a CD-ROM drive), or even `/dev/fd0`
    (floppy drive).

    Knowing that Linux organizes attached storage as block devices, you can move
    to the `/sys/block/` directory and list its contents. Among the contents
    will be a directory called `sda/`. Among its contents, you’ll probably see
    files with names like `sda1`, `sda2`, and `sda5`. Each of these represents
    one of the partitions created by Linux to better organize the data on your
    drive.

    </Solution>

13. What is a loop device?

    <Solution>

    A _loop device_ is a pseudo device that allows a file to be used as though
    it's an actual physical device.

    </Solution>

14. Test the `sudo` command.

    <Solution>

    ```sh
    sudo cat /etc/shadow
    ```

    </Solution>

15. How to get help for Linux commands?

    <Solution>

    `man`, `info` and the Internet.

    You can access all system logs through `journalctl` (on nearly all modern
    Linux distributions), when you ask for help on the Internet.

    Example:

    ```sh
    journalctl | grep filename.php | grep error
    ```

    In case you'd prefer to see only those lines that don't contain the word
    _error_:

    ```sh
    journalctl | grep filename.php | grep -v error
    ```

    </Solution>

16. Define the following terms: _file system_, _process_, _disk partition_,
    _Bash_, _plain text_, _file globbing_, _tab completion_ and _pseudo file
    systems_.

    <Solution>

    - A _file system_ is made up of data files indexed in a way that allows the
      perception of a directory-based organization.
    - A _process_ is an active instance of a running software program.
    - A _disk partition_ is the logical division of a physical storage device
      that can be made to work exactly like a standalone device. Partitions are
      common organizational tools for all modern operating systems.
    - _Bash_ is a command-line user interface for executing system actions.
    - _Plain text_ that is usable for administration purposes is text made up of
      a limited set of characters and contains no extraneous formatting code.
    - _File globbing_ involves using wildcard characters to refer to multiple
      files with a single command.
    - _Tab completion_ employs the Tab key to suggest possible completions of a
      partially typed command.
    - _Pseudo file systems_ are directories containing files with dynamic data
      automatically generated at or after system boot.
