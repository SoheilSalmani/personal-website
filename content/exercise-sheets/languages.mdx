1. What are the two core components of languages:

   <Solution>

   **Grammar** and **vocabulary**.

   </Solution>

2. What are the four skills a language is expressed through?

   <Solution>

   1. **Reading**—This is the main source of input for most language learners
   2. **Writing**—This skill generally comes with reading, but effective writing
      often requires learning spelling or stroke order
   3. **Listening**—This involves learning the language’s sound system,
      including vowels, consonants, and tones
   4. **Speaking**—This mostly involves learning to produce the language’s sound
      system yourself

   The skills of reading and listening together are called **input** (or
   content). The skills of writing and speaking are called **output**.

   </Solution>

3. Describe the requirements for a good intermediate level.

   <Solution>

   - Basic grammar knowledge—Basic verb and noun forms, a good understanding of
     the general structure and logic of the language
   - A functional vocabulary—approximately 1,000–2,000 words, enough to be
     understood in basic conversations
   - The basics of the four key skills—enough to function in whatever context
     you are learning for

   </Solution>

4. What are the three core resources to achieve effectively and rapidly this
   goal.

   <Solution>

   **A beginner course** is any kind of course that tries to teach you the
   fundamentals, such as the core grammar and basic vocabulary in a structured
   manner.

   **A flashcard program** helps you learn vocabulary and grammar by repeatedly
   showing you words or sentences and asking you to recollect their meaning.

   **Input** is any piece of content produced in the language such as books,
   news, or movies.
