   ```

   </Solution>

2. (Python Workout) Exercise 1: Number guessing game.

   <Solution>

   ```python fp=number_guessing_game.py nu
   import random

   def ask_number():
       required_base = random.choice([2, 8, 10, 16])
       user_input = input(f"What is your guess (base {required_base})? ")
       if not user_input.isdigit():
           print("Please, give a number between 0 and 100.")
           return ask_number()
       return int(user_input, required_base)

   def launch_guessing_game():
       answer = random.randint(0, 100)
       remaining_guesses = 12

       while remaining_guesses > 0:
           user_guess = ask_number()
           if user_guess == answer:
               print(f"Right! The answer is {user_guess}")
               break
           if user_guess < answer:
               print(f"Your guess of {user_guess} is too low!")
           else:
               print(f"Your guess of {user_guess} is too high!")
           remaining_guesses -= 1
       else:
           print("Your three chances are up!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       launch_guessing_game()
   ```

   ```python fp=word_guessing_game.py nu
   import random

   WORDS = [word.strip().lower() for word in open('words.txt')]

   def ask_word():
       return input(f"What is your guess? ").lower()

   def launch_guessing_game():
       answer = random.choice(WORDS).lower()

       while True:
           user_guess = ask_word()
           if user_guess == answer:
               print(f"Right! The answer is {user_guess}")
               break
           if user_guess < answer:
               print(f"Your guess of {user_guess} is too low!")
           else:
               print(f"Your guess of {user_guess} is too high!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       launch_guessing_game()
   ```

   </Solution>
