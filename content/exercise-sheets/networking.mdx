1. Give two generic terms to specify devices connected to the Internet.

   <Solution>

   **Hosts** and **end systems**. End systems are also referred to as hosts
   because they host (that is, run) application programs.

   </Solution>

2. Give the two main elements used in a network to connect end systems.

   <Solution>

   Communication links and packet switches.

   </Solution>

3. What is the transmission rate?

   <Solution>

   It's the amount of data transmitted per second, measured in bits/second, in a
   communication link.

   </Solution>

4. What is packets?

   <Solution>

   When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end
   system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting
   packages of information, known as **packets** in the jargon of computer
   networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system,
   where they are reassembled into the original data.

   </Solution>

5. What is the role of a packet switch?

   <Solution>

   A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
   links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.

   </Solution>

6. What are the two most prominent types of packet switches? In which type of
   network each of them is typically used?

   <Solution>

   Packet switches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent
   types in today’s Internet are **routers** and **link-layer switches**. Both
   types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations.
   Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are
   typically used in the network core.

   </Solution>

7. What is a route (or path)?

   <Solution>

   It's the sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a
   packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system.

   </Solution>

8. What is an ISP?

   <Solution>

   End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs)**. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and
   communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the
   end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or
   DSL, high-speed local area network access, and mobile wireless access. ISPs
   also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting servers
   directly to the Internet.

   </Solution>

9. How ISPs interconnect each other in the Internet?

   <Solution>

   The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, ISPs that
   provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. These lowertier
   ISPs are thus interconnected through national and international upper-tier
   ISPs and these upper-tier ISPs are connected directly to each other. An
   upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed
   fiber-optic links. Each ISP network, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is
   managed independently, runs the IP protocol, and conforms to certain naming
   and address conventions.

   </Solution>

10. Give two of the most important protocols in the Internet?

    <Solution>

    **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and **Internet Protocol (IP)**.

    </Solution>

11. What is the name given to collectively refer the Internet’s principal
    protocols?

    <Solution>

    The Internet’s principal protocols are collectively known as **TCP/IP**.

    </Solution>

12. What is the role of the IP protocol?

    <Solution>

    The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and
    received among routers and end systems.

    </Solution>

13. What action has been taken to make all Internet systems and products
    interoperable?

    <Solution>

    The definition of **Internet standards**.

    </Solution>

14. Who develop the Internet standards? How?

    <Solution>

    Internet standards are developed by the **Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF)**. The IETF standards documents are called **requests for comments
    (RFCs)**. RFCs started out as general requests for comments to resolve
    network and protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the
    Internet.

    </Solution>

15. Cite 4 protocols defined by the IETF.

    <Solution>

    TCP, IP, HTTP and SMTP.

    </Solution>
