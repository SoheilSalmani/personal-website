1. What is physiology?

   <Solution>

   Physiology is the science that seeks to explain the physical and chemical
   mechanisms that are responsible for the origin, development, and progression
   of life. Each type of life, from the simplest virus to the largest tree or
   the complicated human being, has its own functional characteristics.
   Therefore, the vast field of physiology can be divided into viral physiology,
   bacterial physiology, cellular physiology, plant physiology, invertebrate
   physiology, vertebrate physiology, mammalian physiology, human physiology,
   and many more subdivisions.

2. Describe what a cell is.

   <Solution>

   The basic living unit of the body is the cell. Each tissue or organ is an
   aggregate of many different cells held together by intercellular supporting
   structures.

   Each type of cell is specially adapted to perform one or a few particular
   functions. For example, the red blood cells, numbering about 25 trillion in
   each person, transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Although the red
   blood cells are the most abundant of any single type of cell in the body,
   there are also trillions of additional cells of other types that perform
   functions different from those of the red blood cell. The entire body, then,
   contains about 35 to 40 trillion human cells.

   The many cells of the body often differ markedly from one another but all
   have certain basic characteristics that are alike. For example, the general
   chemical mechanisms for changing nutrients into energy are basically the same
   in all cells, and all cells deliver products of their chemical reactions into
   the surrounding fluids.

   Almost all cells also have the ability to reproduce additional cells of their
   own type. Fortunately, when cells of a particular type are destroyed, the
   remaining cells of this type usually generate new cells until the supply is
   replenished.

   </Solution>

3. What is microbiota?

   <Solution>

   In addition to human cells, trillions of microbes inhabit the body, living on
   the skin and in the mouth, gut, and nose. The gastrointestinal tract, for
   example, normally contains a complex and dynamic population of 400 to 1000
   species of microorganisms that outnumber our human cells. Communities of
   microorganisms that inhabit the body, often called _microbiota_, can cause
   diseases, but most of the time they live in harmony with their human hosts
   and provide vital functions that are essential for survival of their hosts.
   Although the importance of gut microbiota in the digestion of foodstuffs is
   widely recognized, additional roles for the body’s microbes in nutrition,
   immunity, and other functions are just beginning to be appreciated and
   represent an intensive area of biomedical research.

4. Define intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid.

   <Solution>

   About 50% to 70% of the adult human body is fluid, mainly a water solution of
   ions and other substances. Although most of this fluid is inside the cells
   and is called _intracellular fluid_, about one-third is in the spaces outside
   the cells and is called _extracellular fluid_. This extracellular fluid is in
   constant motion throughout the body. It is transported rapidly in the
   circulating blood and then mixed between the blood and tissue fluids by
   diffusion through the capillary walls.

   </Solution>

5. Explain what the internal environment (or _milieu intérieur_) is.

   <Solution>

   In the extracellular fluid are the ions and nutrients needed by the cells to
   maintain life. Thus, all cells live in essentially the same environment—the
   extracellular fluid. For this reason, the extracellular fluid is also called
   the _internal environment_ of the body, or the _milieu intérieur_.

   Cells are capable of living and performing their special functions as long as
   the proper concentrations of oxygen, glucose, different ions, amino acids,
   fatty substances, and other constituents are available in this internal
   environment.

   </Solution>

6. What the extracellular and intracellular fluids contain.

   <Solution>

   The extracellular fluid contains large amounts of sodium, chloride, and
   bicarbonate ions plus nutrients for the cells, such as oxygen, glucose, fatty
   acids, and amino acids. It also contains carbon dioxide that is being
   transported from the cells to the lungs to be excreted, plus other cellular
   waste products that are being transported to the kidneys for excretion.

   The intracellular fluid contains large amounts of potassium, magnesium, and
   phosphate ions instead of the sodium and chloride ions found in the
   extracellular fluid. Special mechanisms for transporting ions through the
   cell membranes maintain the ion concentration differences between the
   extracellular and intracellular fluids.

   </Solution>

7. What is homeostasis?

   <Solution>

   _Homeostasis_ to describe the maintenance of nearly constant conditions in
   the internal environment. Essentially, all organs and tissues of the body
   perform functions that help maintain these relatively constant conditions.
   For example, the lungs provide oxygen to the extracellular fluid to replenish
   the oxygen used by the cells, the kidneys maintain constant ion
   concentrations, and the gastrointestinal system provides nutrients while
   eliminating waste from the body.

   The various ions, nutrients, waste products, and other constituents of the
   body are normally regulated within a range of values, rather than at fixed
   values. For some of the body’s constituents, this range is extremely small.

   </Solution>

8. What is a disease (in relation with homeostasis)?

   <Solution>

   _Disease_ is often considered to be a state of disrupted homeostasis.
   However, even in the presence of disease, homeostatic mechanisms continue to
   operate and maintain vital functions through multiple compensations. In some
   cases, these compensations may lead to major deviations of the body’s
   functions from the normal range, making it difficult to distinguish the
   primary cause of the disease from the compensatory responses.

   </Solution>

9. What is pathophysiology?

   <Solution>

   _Pathophysiology_ is the study of disordered body function and the basis for
   clinical medicine. The discipline of pathophysiology seeks to explain how the
   various physiological processes are altered in diseases or injury.

   </Solution>

10. How extracellular fluid is transported through the body?

    <Solution>

    Extracellular fluid is transported through the body in two stages. The first
    stage is movement of blood through the body in the blood vessels. The second
    is movement of fluid between the blood capillaries and the _intercellular
    spaces_ between the tissue cells.

    </Solution>

11. Explain briefly how the nervous system works.

    <Solution>

    The nervous system is composed of three major parts:

    - the **sensory input portion**
    - the **central nervous system** (or **integrative portion**)
    - the **motor output portion**

    Sensory receptors detect the state of the body and its surroundings. The
    central nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord. The brain
    stores information, generates thoughts, creates ambition, and determines
    reactions that the body performs in response to the sensations. Appropriate
    signals are then transmitted through the motor output portion of the nervous
    system to carry out one's desires.

    An important segment of the nervous system is called the _autonomic system_.
    It operates at a subconscious level and controls many functions of internal
    organs, including the level of pumping activity by the heart, movements of
    the gastrointestinal tract, and secretion by many of the body's glands.

    </Solution>

12. Explain briefly how the hormone systems work.

    <Solution>

    Located in the body are _endocrine glands_, organs and tissues that secrete
    chemical substances called _hormones_. Hormones are transported in the
    extracellular fluid to other parts of the body to help regulate cellular
    function. Thus, the hormones provide a regulatory system that complements
    the nervous system. The nervous system controls many muscular and secretory
    activites of the body, whereas the hormonal system regulates many metabolic
    functions. The nervous and hormonal systems normally work together in a
    coordinated manner to control essentially all the organ systems of the body.

    </Solution>

13. Describe briefly how the immune system work.

    <Solution>

    The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to carry out the
    following:

    1. distinguish its own cells from harmful foreign cells and substances,
    2. destroy the invader by _phagocytosis_ or by producing _sensitized
       lymphocytes_ or specialized proteins (e.g., _antibodies_) that destroy or
       neutralize the invader.

    </Solution>

14. What is the integumentary system?

    <Solution>

    The skin and its various appendages (including the hair, nails, glands, and
    other structures) cover, cushion, and protect the deeper tissues and organs
    of the body and generally provide a boundary between the body’s internal
    environment and the outside world. The integumentary system is also
    important for temperature regulation and excretion of wastes, and it
    provides a sensory interface between the body and the external environment.
