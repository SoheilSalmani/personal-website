1. Generate a project using Maven in interactive mode, and in non-interactive
   mode (give an archetype version).

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4
   mvn -B archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4
   ```

   </Solution>

2. Build a JAR using Maven, and run it with `java`.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   mvn package
   java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App
   ```

   </Solution>

3. Inform Maven the Java release you are targetting, and a character encoding
   scheme to use for the reading and writing of files.

   <Solution>

   ```xml fp=pom.xml hl=6..7
   <project ...>

     ...

     <properties>
       <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
       <maven.compiler.release>17</maven.compiler.release>
     </properties>

      ...
   </project>
   ```

   </Solution>

4. Clean the `target/` folder, copy all dependencies in a `target/dependency/`
   folder, then build the JAR file.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package
   ```

   </Solution>

5. Generate a site based upon information on the project's POM.

   <Solution>

   ```shell
   mvn site
   ```

   </Solution>

6. Compile your application sources using Maven. Where are the compiled classes?

   <Solution>

   ```sh
   mvn compile
   ```

   The compiled classes were placed in `target/classes/`.

   </Solution>

7. Compile and execute your tests. Then, compile your test sources but do not
   execute the tests.

   <Solution>

   To compile and execute your tests, run:

   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

   If you simply want to compile your test sources (but not execute the tests),
   run:

   ```sh
   mvn test-compile
   ```

   </Solution>

8. Create a JAR and install it in your local repository.

   <Solution>

   To build your JAR file, run:

   ```sh
   mvn package
   ```

   To install the artifact you've generated (the JAR file) in your local
   repository (`~/.m2/repository` is the default location), run:

   ```sh
   mvn install
   ```

   </Solution>

9. Which plugin looks for tests contained in files with a particular naming
   convention, and executes them?

   <Solution>

   The surefire plugin (which executes the test) looks for tests contained in
   files with a particular naming convention. By default the tests included are:

   - `**/*Test.java`
   - `**/Test*.java`
   - `**/*TestCase.java`

   And the default excludes are:

   - `**/Abstract*Test.java`
   - `**/Abstract*TestCase.java`

   </Solution>

10. What is a SNAPSHOT version?

    <Solution>

    The `SNAPSHOT` value refers to the _latest_ code along a development branch,
    and provides no guarantee the code is stable or unchanging. Conversely, the
    code in a _release_ version is unchanging.

    </Solution>

11. Add a new plugin and configure it.

    <Solution>

    ```xml fp=pom.xml
    ...
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
              <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
              <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>3.0.0</version>
              <configuration>
                <executable>java</executable>
                <arguments>
                  <argument>-cp</argument>
                  <classpath />
                  <argument>com.mycompany.app.App</argument>
                </arguments>
              </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    ...
    ```

    The `configuration` element applies the given parameters to every goal from
    a plugin. It is also possible to add new goals to the process, and configure
    specific goals.

    **Note:** Without a specified version, the default behavior is to use the
    latest available.

    </Solution>

12. Add resources in a JAR file?

    <Solution>

    ```sh
    mkdir -p src/main/resources/META-INF
    touch src/main/resources/application.properties
    mkdir src/test/resources
    touch src/test/resources/test.properties
    ```

    **Note:** You will also notice some other files there like
    `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` as well as a `pom.xml` and `pom.properties` file.
    These come standard with generation of a JAR in Maven. You can create your
    own manifest if you choose, but Maven will generate one by default if you
    don't.

    </Solution>
