1. Define $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$.

   <Solution>

   - Set of **positive integers** (or **natural numbers**):

     $$
     \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\} \, .
     $$

   - The set of integers:

     $$
     \mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\} \, .
     $$

   - The set of **rational numbers**:

     $$
     \mathbb{Q} = \left\{\frac{m}{n} : m, n \in \mathbb{Z}, n \ne 0 \right\} \, .
     $$

   </Solution>

2. Define what a irrational number is using the number line. Define
   $\mathbb{R}$.

   <Solution>

   Geometrically, the integers can be represented by points on a line by fixing
   a base point (signifying the number 0) and a unit distance. Such a line is
   called the **number line**. By suitably subdividing the segment between 0 and
   1, we can also represent rational numbers such as $1/n$, where
   $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and this can, in turn, be used to represent any rational
   number by a unique point on the number line.

   It is seen that the rational numbers spread themselves rather densely on this
   line. Nevertheless, several gaps remain. For example, the “number” $\sqrt{2}$
   can be represented by a unique point between 1 and 2 on the number line using
   simple geometric constructions this is not a rational number. We are
   therefore forced to reckon with the so-called _irrational numbers_, which are
   precisely the “numbers” needed to fill the gaps left on the number line after
   marking all the rational numbers. The rational numbers and the irrational
   numbers together constitute the set $\mathbb{R}$, called the set of _real
   numbers_.

   </Solution>

3. Give the five algebraic properties of $\mathbb{R}$.

   <Solution>

   The set $\mathbb{R}$ has the operations of addition (denoted by $+$) and
   multiplication (denoted by $\cdot$ or by juxtaposition), which extend the
   usual addition and multiplication of rational numbers and satisfy the
   following properties.

   - **(A1)** $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$ and $a(bc) = (ab)c$ for all
     $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$.
   - **(A2)** $a + b = b + a$ and $ab = ba$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$.
   - **(A3)** There are distinct elements $0, 1 \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the
     following: $a + 0 = a$ and $a \cdot 1 = a$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$.
   - **(A4)** Given any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, there is $a' \in \mathbb{R}$ such
     that $a + a' = 0$. Further, if $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is such that $a \ne 0$,
     then there is $a^* \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $aa^* = 1$.
   - **(A5)** $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$.

   </Solution>

4. Prove that $a \cdot 0 = 0$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$.

   <Solution>

   First, by A3, $0 + 0 = 0$. So, by A5,
   $a \cdot 0 = a(0 + 0) = a \cdot 0 + a \cdot 0$. Now, by A4, there is a
   $b' \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a \cdot 0 + b' = 0$. Thus,

   $$
   0 = a \cdot 0 + b' = (a \cdot 0 + a \cdot 0) + b' = a \cdot 0 + (a \cdot 0 + b') = a \cdot 0 + 0 = a \cdot 0 \, ,
   $$

   where the third equality follows from A1 and the last equality follows from
   A3.

   </Solution>

5. Define the _negative_ (or _additive inverse_) of $a$. Same with the
   _reciprocal_ (or _multiplicative inverse_) of $a$.

   <Solution>

   Given any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, an element $a' \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
   $a + a' = 0$ is unique; this element will be called the **negative** or the
   **additive inverse** of $a$ and is denoted by $-a$. Likewise, if
   $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a \ne 0$, then an element $a^* \in \mathbb{R}$ such
   that $aa^* = 1$ is unique; this element is called the **reciprocal** or the
   **multiplicative inverse** of $a$ and is denoted by $a^{-1}$ or by $1/a$.

   </Solution>

6. What is the value of $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ and $\prod_{i=1}^n a_i$ if $n = 0$?

   <Solution>

   If $n = 0$, then $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i := 0$, whereas $\prod_{i=1}^n a_i := 1$.

   </Solution>

7. Give the two order properties of $\mathbb{R}$. Define an _order relation_ on
   $\mathbb{R}$.

   <Solution>

   The set $\mathbb{R}$ contains a subset $\mathbb{R}^+$, called the set of all
   positive real numbers, satisfying the following properties:

   - **(O1)** Given any $a \in \mathbb{R}$, exactly one of the following
     statements is true:

     $$
     a \in \mathbb{R}^+ ; \quad a = 0; \quad -a \in \mathbb{R}^+ \, .
     $$

   - **(O2)** If $a,b \in \mathbb{R}^+$, then $a + b \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and
     $ab \in \mathbb{R}^+$.

   Given the existence of $\mathbb{R}^+$, we can define an _order relation_ on
   $\mathbb{R}$ as follows. For $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, define $a$ to be **less
   than** $b$, and write $a < b$, if $b - a \in \mathbb{R}^+$. Sometimes, we
   write $b > a$ in place of $a < b$ and say that $b$ is **greater than** $a$.
   With this notation, it follows from the algebraic properties that
   $\mathbb{R}^+ = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x > 0\}$.
