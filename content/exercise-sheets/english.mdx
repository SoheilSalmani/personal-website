## Grammar

### Question forms

1. What are the two basic types of question.

   <Solution>

   1. **Yes/no questions** often begin with the verb **to be**, but can also
      begin with other **auxiliary verbs**, such as **do**. We ask these when we
      want a **yes** or **no** answer.
   2. **Wh-questions** start with a question word, such as **who**, **what**,
      **where**, **when**, **why** or **how**. We ask this type of question when
      we want **different kinds of information**. These questions cannot be
      answered with a yes or no.

   </Solution>

2. Describe the form of each type of question.

   <Solution>

   **Yes/no questions** that begin with the verb **to be** are made with **to
   be + subject**. If we start with an **auxiliary verb**, the order is
   **auxiliary + subject + main verb**.

   **Wh-questions** can be used to ask about the **subject** or **object** of
   the verb. Compare these questions:

   - **Who loves Lucy?**
   - **Who does Lucy love?**

   For **subject questions, the order is **question word + verb + object\*\*.

   The **object** question form is **question word + auxiliary + subject +
   verb**.

   **Note:** The question word how is usually combined with other words when
   asking for information, such as size (_how big_), someone’s age (_how old_),
   or the price of something (_how much_).

   **Spoken English:** In formal situations, it is common to respond to a yes/no
   question by **repeating the auxiliary** in a complete sentence. In casual
   spoken English, we **do not** need to repeat the auxiliary. Answers do not
   always contain 'yes' or 'no' (i.e "Not really.", "Absolutely!").

   </Solution>

3. Rearrange the words to make 'yes/no' and wh-questions.

   1. anywhere did you weekend interesting last go?
   2. grow up did you where?
   3. did for your car new much how pay you?
   4. into your when you did move new house?
   5. listening to what you are?
   6. the game basketball who won?
   7. I borrow can your phone?
   8. you do watch want movie a tonight to?

   <Solution>

   1. Did you go anywhere interesting last weekend? [The order of yes/no
      questions is: auxiliary + subject + main verb.]
   2. Where did you grow up? [The order of object Wh-questions is: question word
      - auxiliary + subject + verb.]
   3. How much did you pay for your new car? [The order of object Wh-questions:
      question word + auxiliary + subject + verb.]
   4. When did you move into your new house? [The order of object Wh-questions
      is: question word + auxiliary + subject + verb.]
   5. What are you listening to? [The order of object Wh-questions is: question
      word + auxiliary + subject + verb.]
   6. Who won the basketball game? [The order of subject Wh-questions is:
      question word + verb + object.]
   7. Can I borrow your phone? [The order of yes/no questions is: auxiliary +
      subject + main verb.]
   8. Do you want to watch a movie tonight? [The order of yes/no questions is:
      auxiliary + subject + main verb.]

   </Solution>

### Present continuous and simple tenses

1. When present simple is used?

   <Solution>

   We use the present simple:

   - things that we do regularly
   - facts and truths
   - habits
   - permanent situations

   We often use adverbs of frequency and time expressions like **every day**,
   **once a week**, **on Fridays**.

   </Solution>

2. When present continuous is used?

   <Solution>

   We use the present continuous for:\

   - things that are happening now - at the time we are speaking
   - temporary situations
   - activities that are in progress

   We often use time expressions like **at the moment**, **today**, **this
   week**.

   </Solution>

3. Describe the positive form of present simple and present continuous.

   <Solution>

   The present simple has the same form as the infinitive without 'to' for _I_,
   _you_, _we_, and _they_. For _he_, _she_ and _it_, we add **-s** or **-es**
   to the infinitive.

   The present continuous for _I_ is **subject + am + verb-ing**. For _you_,
   _we_ and _they_: **subject + are + verb-ing**. For _he_, _she_, _it_:
   **subject + is + verb-ing**. We usually use contractions (_I'm_, _he's_,
   _they're_, etc.) when we are speaking.

   </Solution>

4. Describe the negative form of present simple and present continuous.

   <Solution>

   The negative present simple is **subject + don't (do not) + infinitive
   without 'to'** for _I_, _you_, _we_ and _they_, and **subject + doesn't (does
   not) + infinitive without 'to'** for _he_, _she_ and _it_.

   The negative present continuous for _I_ is **I'm not + verb-ing**. For _you_,
   _we_ and _they_: **subject + aren't + verb-ing**. For _he_, _she_, _it_:
   **subject + isn't + verb-ing**.

   **Note:** There are some verbs that we don’t usually use in the continuous
   form. They are often verbs linked to the senses and thinking, for example:
   **hear**, **see**, **smell**, **hate**, **know**, **understand**,
   **believe**, **want**, **need**.

   </Solution>

5. Describe the question form of present simple and present continuous.

   <Solution>

   The present simple question form is **do/does + subject + infinitive without
   'to'**.

   The present continuous question form is **am/is/are + subject + verb-ing**.

   </Solution>

6. Match questions 1-8 with answers a-h.

   - 1. Does it snow in the UK?
   - 2. Is it snowing in the UK?
   - 3. Do you work here?
   - 4. Are you working today?
   - 5. Where do you live?
   - 6. Where are you living?
   - 7. What do you drink?

   - c. No, I’ve got a day off.
   - d. Just coke, usually.
   - e. It’s water.
   - f. In a friend’s flat in London.
   - g. Not right now.
   - h. Only in winter.

   <Solution>

   1. Does it snow in the UK? (h) Only in winter. [Use the present simple for
      truths and facts.]
   2. Is it snowing in the UK? (g) Not right now. [Use the present continuous
      for things that are/aren’t happening now.]
   3. Do you work here? (b) Yes, I’m the managing director. [Use the present
      simple for permanent situations.]
   4. Are you working today? (c) No, I’ve got a day off. [Use the present
      continuous for temporary situations.]
   5. Where do you live? (a) My home’s in Brazil. [Use the present simple for
      permanent situations.]
   6. Where are you living? (f) In a friend’s flat in London. [Use the present
      continuous for temporary situations.]
   7. What do you drink? (d) Usually just coke. [Use the present simple for
      habits.]
   8. What are you drinking? (e) It’s water. [Use the present continuous for
      things happening now.]

   </Solution>

### 'Like' for preference and description

1. Describe how 'like' works as a verb and preposition.

   <Solution>

   1. **Like** can be used as a **verb** to express a preference or interest in
      a person, place or thing.
   2. **Like** can be used as a **preposition** to ask for a description of a
      person, place or thing.

   **Spoken English:** In formal speech (or writing), each word in a question
   usually appears separately. However, we usually use contractions in informal
   speech (and writing).

   </Solution>

2. Describe its question form as preposition.

   <Solution>

   We use **like** as a preposition in this set phrase: **what + to be +
   noun/noun phrase + like?**.

   **Note:** When asking for preference, we use like with **do** or **does** in
   the question. We don’t use **do** or **does** when asking for a description.
   Instead, we start the question with **what** and end with **like**.

   **Note:** We can specify time and place when asking for a description by
   using a phrase at the end of the question.

   </Solution>

3. Match questions 1-8 with answers a-h.

   - 1. What’s your new music teacher like?
   - 2. What was your weekend like?

   - e. He likes football and baseball.
   - f. Horrible! He’s so strict.
   - g. I like action movies. They’re exciting!
   - h. It was fun! We went swimming.

   <Solution>

   1. What’s your new music teacher like? (f) Horrible! He’s so strict. [This
      question is asking for a description (of a person). You can tell becuase
      it begins with ‘What’ and ends with ‘like’.]
   2. What was your weekend like? (h) It was fun! We went swimming. [This
      question is asking for a description (of a time). You can tell becuase it
      begins with ‘What’ and ends with ‘like’.]
   3. Do you like watching horror movies? (a) No, I don’t. They’re so scary!
      [This question is asking about preference (of a thing). You can tell
      becuase it begins with ‘Do’.]
   4. What are your new neighbours like? (b) They’re really friendly. I like
      them a lot. [This question is asking for a description (of people). You
      can tell because it begins with ‘What’ and ends with ‘like’.]
   5. What movies do you like? (g) I like action movies. They’re exciting! [This
      question is asking about preference (of thing). as it begins with ‘Do’]
   6. What sports does your brother like? (e) He likes football and baseball.
      [This question is asking about preference (of thing). You can tell because
      it has ‘does’ in the question.]
   7. Do you like your new shoes? (c) Yes, I do. I like them a lot! [This
      question is asking about preference (of thing). You can tell because it
      begins with ‘Do’.]
   8. What’s the weather like? (d) It’s sunny and warm. [This question is asking
      for a description (of thing). You can tell because it begins with ‘What’
      and ends with ‘like’.]

   </Solution>

### Adverbs of frequency

1. What are adverbs of frequencies, and give some of the most common ones.

   <Solution>

   Adverbs give us more information about a verb. Adverbs of frequency tell us
   **how often** an activity happens. There are many adverbs to choose from.
   Here are some of the most common ones: **always**, **usually**, **often**,
   **sometimes**, **rarely**, **hardly ever**, **never**.

   We can use adverbs of frequency with the verb **to be**.

   We can use **modal verbs** with adverbs of frequency. For example, we can use
   the auxiliary verbs **can**, **should**, and **might**, which express
   **ability (can)**, **obligation (should)**, and **possibility (might)**.

   **Spoken English:** Some people pronounce the **/t/ sound** in **often**;
   other people pronounce often with a 'silent t'. Both are acceptable.

   </Solution>

2. Describe their use in different forms.

   <Solution>

   Adverbs of frequency go before the main verb: **subject + adverb + main
   verb**.

   They go after the verb 'to be'.

   They go between a modal and the main verb: **subject + modal + adverb + main
   verb**.

   In negative form, the adverb of frequency goes between the auxiliary and the
   main verb. It goes after ‘to be’.

   For questions, the order is **auxiliary + subject + adverb of frequency +
   verb**.

   **Note:** Negative adverbs such as **never**, **seldom**, **rarely** and
   **hardly ever** cannot be used in negative sentences. The following sentence
   is incorrect, because it has a **double negative**.

   **Note:** **Sometimes** and **occasionally** can go in the front, middle
   (before the main verb), or end position of a sentence.

   **Note:** We usually use adverbs of frequency with the present simple, but
   they can also be used with the present continuous. The adverb comes between
   the auxiliary and the main verb.

   </Solution>

### 'Have to' and 'must'

1. Desribe the use of _have to_ and _must_.

   <Solution>

   If you **have to do** something, it is necessary for you to do it. It's a
   law, an obligation or a fact.

   If you **must do** something, it is necessary for you to do it, but this is
   often your opinion or a rule that you have made yourself.

   We see **must** (not **have to**) in formal written notices or rules that an
   organization has made itself.

   We can often use either **have to** or **must** in a sentence. But be
   careful! There a big difference in meaning between **don’t have to** and
   **mustn’t**.If you **don’t have to do** something, it isn’t necessary to do
   it, but you can if you want.

   If you **mustn't do** something, it means ‘don’t do it’. It is necessary
   **not** to do it.

   **Note:** In informal British English, we sometimes use **have got to**
   instead of **have to**. They mean the same.

   **Spoken English:** Have to and must are modal verbs. When we say modal
   verbs, we usually say them quickly and often without emphasis. So **have to**
   sounds like ‘hafta’(haf tə). **Must** sounds like ‘mus’ (məs). You don’t hear
   the final /t/ sound in **must**.

   </Solution>

2. Describe their use in different forms.

   <Solution>

   We use **have to / must + infinitive without ‘to’**. Must is the same form
   for all persons. **Have to** changes to **has to** in the third person
   singular.

   Their negative form are **don't/doesn't have to** and **mustn't**.

   It is possible to ask questions with **Must + subject...?** but it is much
   more common to use **Do/Does + subject + have to...?**

   **Note:** There is no future or past form of **must**. We use **will have
   to** (future) and **had to** (past).

   </Solution>

### Past simple

1. When past simple is used?

   <Solution>

   We use the past simple when an action or situation happens and finishes in
   the past. We usually say or know when it happened.

   We often use the past simple in stories, when one thing happens after another
   in the past.

   </Solution>

2. Describe its different forms.

   <Solution>

   For regular verbs, the past simple ends in **-ed**. Irregular verbs have a
   different past form. The past simple form is the same for all persons.

   We make the negative form with **didn’t (did not) + infinitive without
   ‘to’**.

   Past simple wh-word questions are made from **question word + did + subject +
   infinitive**.

   The question word **how** is usually combined with other words when asking
   for information, such as **size**, **time**, or the **price** of something.

   Past simple yes/no questions are made from **did + subject + infinitive
   without ‘to’**.

   **Note:** We often use the past simple with time expressions like
   **yesterday**, **last month**, **six years ago**, **when I was a child**.

   </Solution>

## Vocabulary

### Suffixes: -ee, -able, -ible, -ness

1. Describe the use of the following suffixes: _-ee_, -_able_, _-ible_ and
   _-ness_.

   <Solution>

   - **-ee** creates a noun meaning 'person who receives an action'.
   - **-able** creates an adjective meaning that the subject can do something or
     that something can be done it.
   - **-ible** is a different spelling of **-able**.
   - **-ness** creates a noun which describes a quality or state.

   </Solution>

### Adjectives and adverbs

1. What are the role of adjectives and adverbs. Give some of them.

   <Solution>

   Adjectives are words that describe nouns. Examples: scruffy, casual, smart,
   formal, fashionable.

   Adverbs are words that describe verbs. Examples: scruffily, casually,
   smartly, formally, fashionably.

   </Solution>

### Prefixes: un-, in-, dis-

1. Describe the use of the following prefixes: _un-_, _in-_ and _dis-_. Give
   some example words.

   <Solution>

   These prefixes have the meaning of _not_, or _to do the opposite_. Examples:
   unhappy, uncooked, unclean, intolerable, inexpensive, inactive, disagree,
   disgrace, disgusting.

   </Solution>

### Chunks of language

1. What are chunks (of language)?

   <Solution>

   Chunks are groups of words that can be found together in language. They can
   be words that always go together, such as fixed collocations, or that
   commonly do, such as certain grammatical structures that follow rules. A
   listener or reader uses their knowledge of chunks to help them predict
   meaning and therefore be able to process language in real time. Examples: _to
   do something on an empty stomach_, _a full English breakfast_, _to take a
   long time_, _the rush hour_, _a lot of fun_, _all over the world_, _(I'll be)
   back in a bit_.

   </Solution>

### Binomials

1. What are binomials?

   <Solution>

   In language studies, a pair of words conventionally linked by a conjunction
   (usually _and_) or a preposition is called a _binomial_, or a binomial pair.

   When the word order of the pair is fixed, the binomial is said to be
   irreversible.

   A similar construction involving three nouns or adjectives is called a
   _trinomial_.

   </Solution>

### -ing and -ed adjectives

1. Describe the use of -ing and -ed adjectives.

   <Solution>

   Both **-ing** and **-ed** adjectives help us to talk about our feelings.

   The main difference is that -ing adjectives are usually used to talk about
   the **person**, **place or thing** that is making us feel a certain way.

   But -ed adjectives are used to talk about how **we** feel.

   </Solution>
