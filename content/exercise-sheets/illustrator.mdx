1. Give some basic shortcuts. Open the `Tour1.ai` file, and change the
   background color of an element. Add a new panel on the right, then reset the
   workspace, and close the file.

   <Solution>

   - Selection Tool: `V`.
   - `File > Open...`: `Ctrl + O`.
   - `View > Fit All in Window`: `Alt + Ctrl + 0`.
   - Hide Panels: `Tab`.
   - Reset workspace: `Reset Essentials` (top right).
   - `File > Close`: `Ctrl + W`.

   Use the Selection Tool to select an element, then change the background color
   in the Properties panel (`Appearance > Fill`).

2. Describle the Illustrator workspace.

   <Solution>

   - _Menu bar_ (at the very top) show the `File`, `Edit`, and other menus that
     give you access to a variety of commands, adjustments, settings, and
     panels.
   - _Tools panel_ (on the left) contains tools for creating and editing
     artwork. Similar tools are grouped together. You can access them by
     clicking and holding a tool in the Tools panel.
   - _Panels_ (on the right) include Properties, Layers, and other panels that
     contain a variety of controls for working with artwork. You can find a full
     list of panels under the `Window` menu.
   - _Document window_ (in the middle) displays the file you're currently
     working on. Multiple open documents appear as tabs in the Document window.
