1. Get these
   [files](https://learndownload.adobe.com/pub/learn/premiere/create-project-import-media.zip).
   Open a project and close it. Create a new project and import all the media
   files.

   <Solution>

   - `File > Open Project...`: `Ctrl + O`.
   - `File > Close Project`: `Ctrl + Shift + W`.
   - `File > New Project...`: `Ctrl + Alt + N`.
   - `Window > Media Browser`: `Shift + 8`.

   Select all the media files using `Ctrl + A`, then `Right click > Import`.

   </Solution>

2. List the main elements of the interface.

   <Solution>

   - **Panels:** Each panel has a specific purpose. You can resize or reposition
     them. All panels are accessible in the `Window` menu.
   - **Workspaces:** Preset layouts with panels displayed that are useful for
     particular tasks, such as editing video or working on audio. To reset a
     workspace, choose `Window > Workspace > Reset to Saved Layout` (or
     `Alt + Shift + 0`).
   - **Blue highlight:** Only one panel at a time will have a blue highlight,
     indicating that it is the active panel.

   </Solution>

3. Create a new project. Play one of the video in the media folder in the
   _Source Monitor_. Import six media files from the _Media Browser_ panel.
   Organize your clips using bins, and rename some of them.

   <Solution>

   Bins allow you to organize your clips in the same way that you might organize
   files in folders on your computer. To create a new bin, click the `New Bin`
   button in the _Project panel_.

   **Note:** Actions like renaming clips or moving them to a bin don't affect
   the associated files. You can also right click a clip and click on
   `Reveal in Explorer...`.

   </Solution>

4. Build a sequence.

   <Solution>

   - When you create a sequence, it appears in the _Project_ panel along with
     your clips. You can create as many sequences as you want in the same
     project.
   - To create a new sequence, drag one or more clips into the empty _Timeline_
     panel, or select one or more clips in the _Project_ panel, right-click on
     the selection and choose `New Sequence From Clip`.
   - To remove a clip from the sequence, select it and press `Delete`. If you
     select clips and press `Shift + Delete`, they will be removed without
     leaving a gap in the sequence.

   You can play/pause a sequence anywhere using `Space`.

   </Solution>
