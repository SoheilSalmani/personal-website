1. What is biology ?

   <Solution>

   Biology is the scientific study of life.

   </Solution>

2. Give five unifying themes—ways of thinking about life.

   <Solution>

   - Organization
   - Information
   - Energy and Matter
   - Interactions
   - Evolution

   </Solution>

3. Give ten levels of biological organization.

   <Solution>

   1. The Biosphere. The **biosphere** consists of all life on Earth and all the
      places where life exists.
   2. Ecosystems. An **ecosystem** consists of all the living things in a
      particular area, along with all the nonliving components of the
      environment with which life interacts.
   3. Communities. The array of organisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem is
      called a biological **community**. Each of these forms of life belongs to
      a species—a group whose members can only reproduce with other members of
      the group.
   4. A population consists of all the individuals of a species living within
      the bounds of a specified area that interbreed with each other.
   5. Organisms. Individual living things are called **organisms**.
   6. Organs. An **organ**, a body part that is made up of multiple tissues and
      has specific functions in the body.
   7. Tissues. Each **tissue** is a group of cells that work together,
      performing a specialized function.
   8. Cells. The **cell** is life’s fundamental unit of structure and function.
      Some organisms consist of a single cell, which performs all the functions
      of life. Other organisms are multicellular and feature a division of labor
      among specialized cells.
   9. Organelles. The various functional components present in cells are called
      **organelles**.
   10. Molecules. A **molecule** is a chemical structure consisting of two or
       more units called atoms.

   </Solution>

4. What is reductionism?

   <Solution>

   _Reductionism_ is an approach that reduces complex systems to simpler
   components that are more manageable to study.

   </Solution>

5. What is an emergent property?

   <Solution>

   An emergent property is a property which a collection or complex system has,
   but which the individual members do not have.

   </Solution>

6. What is systems biology?

   <Solution>

   To fully explore emergent properties, biologists today complement
   reductionism with **systems biology**, the exploration of a biological system
   by analyzing the interactions among its parts.

   </Solution>

7. What are the two main forms of cells?

   <Solution>

   We distinguish two main forms of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
   Prokaryotic cells are found in two groups of single-celled microorganisms,
   bacteria (singular, _bacterium_) and archaea (singular, _archaean_). All
   other forms of life, including plants and animals, are composed of eukaryotic
   cells.

   </Solution>

8. Describe the composition of an eukaryotic cell and a prokaryotic cell. Draw a
   representation of an eukaryotic cell and a prokaryotic cell.

   <Solution>

   A **eukaryotic cell** contains membrane-enclosed organelles. Some organelles,
   such as the DNA-containing nucleus, are found in the cells of all eukaryotes;
   other organelles are specific to particular cell types. In contrast to
   eukaryotic cells, a **prokaryotic cell** lacks a nucleus or other
   membrane-enclosed organelles. Furthermore, prokaryotic cells are generally
   smaller than eukaryotic cells.

9. Decribe the relation between chromosomes, DNA and genes.

   <Solution>

   Within cells, structures called chromosomes contain genetic material in the
   form of **DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)**. Each chromosome contains one very
   long DNA molecule with hundreds or thousands of **genes**, each a section of
   the DNA of the chromosome. Transmitted from parents to offspring, genes are
   the units of inheritance. They encode the information necessary to build all
   of the molecules synthesized within a cell, which in turn establish that
   cell’s identity and function.

   </Solution>

10. Describe what a DNA molecule is made of, and how it stores genetic
    information. Define _gene expression_.

    <Solution>

    The molecular structure of DNA accounts for its ability to store
    information. A DNA molecule is made up of two long chains, called strands,
    arranged in a double helix. Each chain is made up of four kinds of chemical
    building blocks called nucleotides, abbreviated A, T, C, and G. Specific
    sequences of these four nucleotides encode the information in genes.

    For many genes, the sequence provides the blueprint for making a protein.
    For instance, a given bacterial gene may specify a particular protein (such
    as an enzyme) required to break down a certain sugar molecule, while one
    particular human gene may denote an enzyme, and another gene a different
    protein (an antibody, perhaps) that helps fight off infection. Overall,
    proteins are major players in building and maintaining the cell and carrying
    out its activities.

    Protein-encoding genes control protein production indirectly, using a
    related molecule called RNA as an intermediary. The sequence of nucleotides
    along a gene is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a
    linked series of protein building blocks called amino acids. Once completed,
    the amino acid chain forms a specific protein with a unique shape and
    function. The entire process by which the information in a gene directs the
    manufacture of a cellular product is called **gene expression**.

    </Solution>

11. Explain the universality of the genetic code.

    <Solution>

    In carrying out gene expression, all forms of life employ essentially the
    same genetic code: A particular sequence of nucleotides means the same thing
    in one organism as it does in another. Differences between organisms reflect
    differences between their nucleotide sequences rather than between their
    genetic codes. This universality of the genetic code is a strong piece of
    evidence that all life is related. Comparing the sequences in several
    species for a gene that codes for a particular protein can provide valuable
    information both about the protein and about the relationship of the species
    to each other.

    </Solution>

12. Define what a genome and a proteome are.

    <Solution>

    The entire “library” of genetic instructions that an organism inherits is
    called its **genome**. The entire set of proteins expressed by a given cell,
    tissue, or organism is called a **proteome**.

    </Solution>

13. Define what genomics and proteomics are.

    <Solution>

    To make sense of the deluge of data from genome-sequencing projects and the
    growing catalog of known gene functions, scientists are applying a systems
    biology approach at the cellular and molecular levels. Rather than
    investigating a single gene at a time, researchers study whole sets of genes
    (or other DNA) in one or more species—an approach called **genomics**.

    Likewise, the term **proteomics** refers to the study of sets of proteins
    and their properties.
