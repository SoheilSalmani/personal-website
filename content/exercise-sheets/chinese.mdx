1. A Chinese Pinyin Syllable can have three parts, which are they?

   <Solution>

   Initial + Final + Tone. But sometimes, there can be no Initial (Chinese
   Syllables with Zero-Initials), or no Tone (Chinese Syllables with the Neutral
   Tone). But there is definitely a Final. Finals are mostly vowels, or stars
   with a vowel. In a Chinese Pinyin Syllable, the Final goes at the very end.
