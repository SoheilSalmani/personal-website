## Bitcoin et cryptomonnaies pour les nuls

1. Quels sont les deux éléments clés d'une monnaie ?

   <Solution>

   - Un élément (pièce, billet, lingo d'or...) auquel nous avons convenu
     d'attribuer une certaine valeur.
   - Un tiers de confiance qui est le garant de la validité de cet élément
     d'échange.

   </Solution>

2. Expliquer le modèle défini par Satoshi Nakamoto dans lequel la confiance ne
   repose plus sur les banques.

   <Solution>

   Dans son modèle, la confiance repose sur :

   - un modèle mathématique sophistiqué : la cryptographie ;
   - nous-mêmes, usagers de la monnaie.

   La différence réside dans le mécanisme de confiance qui a initialement été
   développé et que l'on appelle la _blockchain_.

   </Solution>

3. Qu'est-ce qu'un système _peer-to-peer_ et comment ce type de système a-t-il
   inspiré la création du Bitcoin ?

   <Solution>

   Sur un système _peer to peer_, on dit que l'information est « décentralisée »
   ou « distribuée ». Bitcoin repose sur ce même principe d'informatique
   décentralisée. Chaque ordinateur connecté à un moment donné participe à la
   communauté globale. Il n'existe plus de banque et, donc, plus de serveur
   central. Les données relatives à vos bitcoins ne sont donc pas stockées par
   une entreprise unique, mais réparties entre plusieurs participants.

   Selon une même logique, le logiciel sur lequel repose Bitcoin est _open
   source_ ou « libre », ce qui signifie qu'il n'appartient à aucun éditeur. Ni
   Microsoft, ni Google, ni Sony ne sont propriétaires de Bitcoin ni des
   variantes qui ont pu suivre, comme Ethereum, Ripple ou EOS.

   Le logiciel qui gère une cryptomonnaie donnée est à la disposition de tous,
   et, mieux encore, chacun peut l'adapter à sa guise. Il en est de même pour
   les incroyables applications de la DeFi (finance décentralisée), qui sont en
   train de révolutionner les systèmes de l'épargne rémunérée et de l'assurance.

   </Solution>

4. Peut-on falsifier une transaction ?

   <Solution>

   Pour falsifier une transaction, il faudrait, à partir d'une certaine date,
   pouvoir falsifier la _blockchain_ sur une majorité d'ordinateurs reliés au
   réseau ! Quand bien même cela serait envisageable sur une période
   ultra-brève, il ne serait pas possible de maintenir longtemps une
   _blockchain_ parasite qui puisse soutenir la comparaison avec des centaines
   de milliers de copies licites identiques entre elles et différentes de cette
   dernière.

   </Solution>

5. Décriver le système de « minage ».

   <Solution>

   Le système de « minage » fonctionne de la manière suivante :

   - Chaque transaction en bitcoins est validée par un calcul complexe - une
     vérification mathématique selon un système de cryptage baptisé
     _hashage/SHA256_.
   - Certains des usagers participant au réseau peuvent s'atteler au travail
     consistant à résoudre ce problème de vérification. En d'autres termes, ils
     mettent la puissance de calcul de leur ordinateur au service de cette
     vérification. Ces usagers particuliers sont appelés des _mineurs_.
   - La validation de chaque transaction par ces mineurs prend en compte
     l'identifiant crypté de chaque intervenant mais aussi une _preuve de
     travail_ issue d'un calcul ultra-complexe. Cette preuve de travail permet à
     chacun de vérifier que la transaction est valide. Cette preuve de travail
     est la talon d'Achille du Bitcoin. Son coût écologique est tel qu'il a
     fallu inventer diverses alternatives à la preuve de travail, dont la
     _preuve d'enjeu_.
   - Si l'un de ces mineurs parvient à résoudre ce problème mathématique, il est
     récompensé par un nouveau bitcoin. Dans la pratique, étant donné que
     plusieurs mineurs sont en mesure de résoudre le problème au même moment, le
     gagnant est désigné selon des règles établies par Satoshi Nakamoto.

   </Solution>

6. Comparer la manière dont la valeur du Bitcoin est attribuée par rapport à
   celle du dollar et de l'euro.

   <Solution>

   - La valeur du dollar est garantie par la signature du secrétaire au Trésor.
   - Pour ce qui est de l'euro, sa valeur est certifiée par le président de la
     Banque centrale européenne (BCE). Jusqu'en 2019, c'est la mention « MDraghi
     » qui figurait sur les billets. Depuis 2020, c'est la signature de
     Christine Lagarde qui apparaît sur les nouveaux billets. Cette signature
     garantit que votre billet de 10€ vaut bien 10€ et que quiconque en zone
     Euro acceptera un paiement en échange de ce billet de banque. En
     contrepartie de ce service de tiers de confiance, Christine Lagarde décide
     des taux d'intérêt sur la monnaie européenne, contrôle la masse monétaire,
     évalue les risques d'inflation et oblige même les banques à déclarer à la
     police les transactions suspectes.
   - La valeur du Bitcoin dépend de la demande qui existe à un moment donné pour
     cette monnaie. Et cette valeur est garantit par la _blockchain_, qui assure
     que toutes les transactions effectuées sur cette monnaie sont d'une
     fiabilité incontestable.

   </Solution>

7. Nakamoto considère que les États sont tôt ou tard tentés d'émettre des pièces
   et monnaies qui ne correspondent à aucune production réelle. Et, en agissant
   ainsi, lesdits États en viennent toujours à dévaloriser leur monnaie et à
   s'approprier les économies de leurs administrés. Expliquer le processus.

   <Solution>

   - Plus l'État dépense, plus il est à même d'engendrer des dettes.
   - L'une des solutions consiste à faire fonctionner la « planche à billets ».
     De nouveaux dollars, de nouveaux euros sont mis en circulation. L'État peut
     ainsi rembourser ses dettes. Pourtant, cette production de « monnaie de
     singe » est illusoire car elle entraîne une dévaluation de la monnaie
     puisque celle-ci perd de sa valeur au passage. En effet, à l'origine, une
     monnaie est censée représenter des biens, des services, une production
     d'articles. Avec la « monnaie de singe », nous obtenons une monnaie qui,
     dans le réel, ne correspond plus réellement à son équivalent en biens et
     services.

   </Solution>

8. Expliquer comment Nakamoto tente de résoudre ce problème avec le Bitcoin.

   <Solution>

   Dès le départ, Nakamoto a limité la production de bitcoins sur le long terme
   à 21 millions d'unités. Il lui a ainsi conféré un statut comparable à celui
   d'un métal précieux tel que l'or, plutôt qu'à celui d'une monnaie comme
   l'euro.

   La masse monétaire est fixée à l'avance et la valeur de la monnaie ne peut
   que progresser au fur et à mesure que son nombre d'utilisateurs augmente. Et,
   de fait, le cours du bitcoin évolue en fonction de l'offre et de la demande,
   comme dans le cas de l'or, du platine ou des diamants.

   Le système a été conçu ainsi : de nouveaux bitcoins sont créés toutes les 10
   minutes environ. L'émission des bitcoins a suivi une progression précise :
   une émission rapide au tout début afin de favoriser les premiers entrants et
   qui se ralentit peu à peu.

   </Solution>

9. Pourquoi le bitcoin n'a-t-il pas décoller comme moyen de paiement grand
   public.

   <Solution>

   Ce que Nakamoto n'avait pas prévu, c'est que la limitation de la masse allait
   entraîner une spéculation galopante qui conduit le bitcoin à connaître des
   fluctuations très brutales.

   Ces fluctuations sont le principal obstacle qui empêche le bitcoin de
   décoller comme moyen de paiement grand public. En effet, difficile d'accepter
   un règlement pour un bien ou un service si la valeur de la monnaie peut
   varier de 10 ou 15% en l'espace d'une semaine.

   </Solution>

## Ledger

1. What the fundamental problem before the appearance of blockchain technology
   and Bitcoin.

   <Solution>

   Before, it was not possible to share value in a decentralized manner. If you
   want to share a file or a song with a friend, via WeTransfer or email for
   example, you actually send a copy of the file, and keep the original on your
   device. But if you send one dollar to a friend while keeping that same
   dollar, the dollar loses its value.

   The only way to exchange money was through intermediaries, whether they be
   digital or physical (there you are banks). So the million-dollar question
   was: _how to extend decentralization to the sharing of value?_ In other
   words, _how to create a digital currency that would allow peer-to-peer
   transactions?_

   The answer came up in 2008 with the birth of Bitcoin, the first
   cryptocurrency. When its creator Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper
   called _Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System_. With this pretty
   descriptive title, it explains what Bitcoin is and how it works. By doing so,
   it had carved the path for the cryptocurrency ecosystem and market as well as
   a new way to share peer-to-peer value.

   </Solution>

2. How the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies fit together?

   <Solution>

   Put simply, while cryptocurrency is like digital money, blockchain is the
   network on which the money transactions operate.

   Knowing that, most cryptocurrencies have their own blockchains with their own
   rules. That’s why you have on one hand “the blockchain technology”: the
   generic technical concept, and on the other hand several “blockchains” which
   support the different cryptocurrencies, such as the “Bitcoin blockchain
   network” or “Ethereum Blockchain”.

   While blockchain is the supporting technology, cryptocurrency is so far the
   most common use of this technology.

   </Solution>

3. Give the differences and similarities between cryptocurrencies and fiat
   currencies.

   <Solution>

   Both are mediums of exchange that can be used to store and transfer value, as
   well as to purchase goods and services. Both are legal. Both can be used for
   trading or investment. Both rely on widespread consumer trust to function as
   means of exchange. Both have their value governed by economic factors such as
   supply, demand, work and scarcity. However, there are 5 major critical
   differences. This is where the revolutionary power of crypto lies in.

   ![](/images/crypto-vs-fiat.png)

   By cutting out the middlemen and disrupting the traditional financial system,
   crypto advocates decentralization and individual empowerment.

   </Solution>

4. Explain briefly what is blockchain.

   <Solution>

   In short, blockchain is a decentralized and public digital ledger that
   records any information – like financial transactions – in an anonymous and
   immutable way. Such groundbreaking features provide users with significant
   benefits :

   - Because it is decentralized, there are no third parties involved: no banks,
     no cloudy actors, no administrator, no unexpected fees. Just you and your
     digital assets.
   - As a public record, it provides transparency of all the transactions and
     allows traceability. While this can allow information counter-checking, it
     also makes falsifying information difficult.
   - Information is recorded in both an anonymous and immutable way. It means
     that once data is added to the ledger, it cannot be removed or altered. Nor
     can it the provider be nominatively identified.

   Put together, all these features make blockchain very hard or almost
   impossible to alter or hack. That is what makes blockchain technology so
   powerful. Besides, it provides us with major revolutionary advantages for
   countless applications with one same core principle: fostering the
   decentralization of traditional systems to give power back to the people. And
   this is exactly what cryptocurrencies aim to do with the traditional
   financial system.

   ![](/images/how-does-blockchain-work.png)

   Because the network is composed of multiple computers, which can be located
   all over the world and run by anyone with an Internet connection, it creates
   a decentralized and distributed validation process.

   </Solution>

5. What are the differencies between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake?

   <Solution>

   In the Bitcoin network, the verification and validation of transactions is
   made according to the Proof of Work consensus protocol. But some more recent
   blockchains are based on another consensus mechanism for verification and
   validation called Proof of Stake. Here are the main differences.

   ![](/images/pow-vs-pos.png)

   Another main difference is what PoS allows you to do with your coins:
   staking. It provides you with the option to generate passive income. By
   owning such coins, you can delegate some of your assets to a validator. The
   validator is rewarded with fees and shares parts of it with you. In other
   words, PoS allows you to grow your assets without doing anything. You don’t
   even need to be a validator.

   </Solution>

6. What are the 3 different groups of cryptocurrencies ?

   <Solution>

   **Bitcoin**

   Bitcoin’s goals are about purchasing goods and services and storing value.
   And its blockchain rules are based on the Proof of Work protocol.

   **Altcoins**

   Simply standing for “alternative coins”, this group includes all the
   cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Today, there are more than a thousand
   Altcoins in existence. They can be distinguished in 2 subgroups.

   - **Bitcoin-derived coins:** they are alternate versions of Bitcoin with
     minor changes. Their goals are often to solve any limitations that Bitcoin
     has. One of the most successful is Litecoin, which aims to improve
     transaction speed.
   - **Native coins:** they are very different from Bitcoin, in terms of rules,
     protocols and goals. Among the many rule variations existing between
     blockchains, there is the choice of validation protocol, between Proof of
     Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Some famous native altcoins with PoS
     protocols are TRON (TRX) or TEZOS (WTZ).

   **Crypto tokens**

   Compared to the other two groups, they are completely unique in the fact that
   they do not have their own blockchain. Instead, they only exist on other
   blockchains. There are several blockchains that allow the existence of tokens
   on their network. The most famous one is Ethereum.

   </Solution>

7. What is Ethereum and how it allows the existence of tokens on its network?

   <Solution>

   The Ethereum blockchain was launched in 2015. Its native currency is known as
   Ether (ETH) and it is one of these highly distinctive Altcoins. Ethereum
   quickly became the number two cryptocurrency in terms of market
   capitalization. While being a decentralized and open-source blockchain like
   many other crypto projects, it has made its way to the top by having unique
   goals and features.

   Ethereum has been designed to be a an application layer that others can build
   on and create proprietary ecosystems – all on a single blockchain. While also
   hosting its own native currency (ETH). Very far from Bitcoin’s purpose to be
   a digital currency indeed.

   With such rules, everyone can create their own crypto tokens on the Ethereum
   blockchain, called ERC20 tokens. And each token has its own rules. This means
   that the options are limitless!

   </Solution>

8. What is the name of the problem that Satoshi Nakamoto solved with Bitcoin,
   without sacrificing the principle of decentralization?

   <Solution>

   The **double-spending problem**.

   </Solution>

9. How to assess a crypto's viability?

   <Solution>

   You need to answer the following questions:

   - Is the project answering an existing problem and is it useful for the
     crypto ecosystem?
   - Does the project really need a dedicated crypto to work and achieve its
     ambition?

   Buy only the crypto you believe in once you have educated yourself (by
   reading the reference documents, white papers, etc.).

   </Solution>

10. Do you have to buy a whole coin?

    <Solution>

    Most cryptocurrencies actually give you the possibility to buy a half, a
    quarter or less of a coin. One Bitcoin even has a much larger degree of
    divisibility than a US dollar. While the dollar can be divided into 1/100 of
    1 USD, a Bitcoin is divided into _“Satoshis”_ which are just 1/100,000,000
    of 1 BTC.

    </Solution>

11. Where to buy coins?

    <Solution>

    When it comes to buying your first crypto, cryptocurrency exchanges are the
    most common and convenient (digital) spot to go. They allow you to buy, sell
    and trade your crypto assets in a pretty convenient fashion. Many of the
    famous cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, Binance, Changelly, Bittrex
    and Kraken are in fact exchange platforms.

    Most crypto exchanges are _fiat to crypto_ exchanges which allow you to buy
    coins with your traditional fiat currency, via bank transfer, credit card or
    PayPal for example. But if you want to buy a smaller crypto, you might not
    find it on these fiat to crypto exchanges. You would have to use an
    intermediate platform, such as Ethereum (ETH), then go to a _crypto to
    crypto_ exchange in order to convert your ETH into the desired asset.

    </Solution>

12. Why it is not a good idea to let exchanges storing your crypto assets?

    <Solution>

    Aside from buying, selling and trading cryptocurrencies, exchanges are also
    often used as a place to store your newly purchased crypto assets. However,
    when it comes to storing crypto, exchanges are not very secure and limit
    your freedom. By leaving your assets in an exchange...

    - **Your valuable digital currencies are vulnerable.** Anyone who can figure
      out your login details would be able to access and steal your coins.
      Besides, exchanges are an ideal target for hackers because of the huge
      amount of crypto they can steal – and they’ve been successful more often
      than we’d like.
    - **You don't own that crypto on your account.** There is a big difference
      between buying and owning your crypto. When leaving your crypto on an
      exchange, you aren’t the owner – the exchange is holding your crypto
      assets, much like a bank holding your money.
    - **You are not in control of your asset.** Because the exchange actually
      owns your crypto, you do not have total control over your own assets, nor
      the freedom to do whatever you want with it. The exchange does. This is
      why the exchange can set certain limits to your crypto activities, like
      setting a minimum or maximum withdrawal limit. Crypto assets are digital
      money, they are nowhere physically speaking. They require specific
      security measures to ensure they are truly and safely yours.

    </Solution>

13. What does on-ramping and off-ramping mean?

    <Solution>

    _On-ramping_ simply mean using your regular, fiat money to buy some crypto.
    On-ramping sees you leave the traditional monetary system, and enter into
    the decentralized, blockchain ecosystem instead.

    _Off-ramping_ is when you “cash out” of crypto, converting your coins or
    tokens back into fiat money, or sometimes goods and services.

    </Solution>

14. Are you really "anonymous" when using crypto assets?

    <Solution>

    No matter how you choose to on-ramp into crypto you’ll almost certainly need
    to provide some basic documentation. This can include photographic ID or
    proof of address, depending on what platform you’re using and the level of
    activity of your account. The purpose of this is to provide a means of
    tracing the source of crypto transactions, part of a wider effort to prevent
    it being used for criminal activities.

    So the first thing to note is that, when coming into crypto, your very first
    coin or token purchase will be linked to your real world identity. From
    there, your transactions will be recorded on a (normally) public ledger,
    meaning that with enough effort and knowledge, every transaction you make
    within the blockchain ecosystem can be linked back to your identity.

    </Solution>

15. What are the crypto on-ramp options?

    <Solution>

    **Centralized Exchanges**

    You can on-ramp via a **centralized exchange** (CEX), such as Binance or
    Coinbase. Your first step when on-ramping via a centralized exchange is to
    open an account. This normally requires you to upload a photo of your
    government ID, a selfie, proof of address and your signature. While you can
    create an account on some CEX’s without going through KYC procedures, most
    exchanges limit your access to their services until you’ve provided this
    detail.

    Once you’ve provided this data and your account is created, you’ll be free
    to purchase a variety of coins or tokens using your credit or debit card,
    with your crypto being sent to the platform’s custodial wallet, which was
    created when you set up your account.

    **Decentralized Exchanges with API's**

    Platforms such as MoonPay and Wyre offer a KYC-compliant integration for
    decentralized exchanges, enabling them to offer fiat crypto purchasing. The
    APIs vary but have one central theme – they take care of documentation
    requests and the KYC process, allowing the functionality to be “plugged in”
    to existing DEXs to give them on-ramping capabilities while remaining
    decentralized.

    The main selling point of this type of on-ramp is that your newly purchased
    coins will go directly to your own personal wallet, and not a custodial
    exchange wallet, meaning you’ll have full control over your crypto from the
    moment you buy it.

    **NFT Marketplaces**

    Another really interesting recent development is on-ramping through NFT
    exchanges.

    Platforms such as Rarible and OpenSea have made it possible for users to
    take their first steps into crypto via NFTs, by enabling crypto to be
    purchased on the platform by credit card (here again you’ll need to undergo
    a KYC process).

    **Bitcoin ATMs**

    Bitcoin ATMs are kiosks connected to the Bitcoin network that accept cash
    and convert it into Bitcoin; a new wallet is created each time this is done,
    putting your newly purchased Bitcoin into circulation on the blockchain.

    Unlike an exchange, Bitcoin ATMs are the only time when you do not require
    identification to on-ramp.

    </Solution>

16. What are the crypto off-ramp options?

    <Solution>

    **Spend your crypto on goods and services**

    The simplest way of off-ramping is simply buying goods or services directly
    with your cryptocurrency. This is unlikely to be your principal off-ramp for
    now.

    **Off-ramp through an exchange**

    As with on-ramping, centralized crypto exchanges provide a vector for
    converting your crypto back into fiat. The transaction will entail a small
    service fee, which also differs between platforms. It’s worth noting that
    this process can take anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of days.

    **Off-ramp via a crypto debit card**

    The central premise of crypto debit cards is to allow you to spend your
    crypto as easily as cash.

    The whole objective of crypto was removing the barriers to moving value
    around – that means being able to spend your crypto when and where you like.
    This is why Ledger has announced a partnership with London-based fintech
    Baanx to launch the new crypto debit CL Card, powered by Ledger.

    The CL Card, powered by Ledger, unites the utility of traditional money with
    the freedom and possibilities of decentralized currency, and processes
    payments instantly – just like a regular debit card. So instead of combing
    through retailers to find one who accepts crypto, or spending two days
    checking your bank to see if your exchange funds came through, you can
    simply load your card and start paying.

    The CL Card, powered by Ledger, is a top-up based card that can be recharged
    using the balance of your Ledger Nano. The card is connected to a universal
    payment infrastructure, and converts your crypto to its equivalent value in
    fiat at the moment of purchase.

    Not only does that bring fast and seamless off-ramping to users, it also
    allows you to benefit from your crypto holdings until the moment of
    purchase.

    </Solution>

17. Explain how the double system of private key and public key works.

    <Solution>

    The public key is a public receiving address to which any user in the
    network can send crypto to. Linked to your public key, there is your private
    key. This one is comparable to an actual key as it unlocks the right for its
    owner to access and spend the associated cryptocurrencies. Your private key
    is yours and only yours, and should therefore remain private. Indeed, anyone
    that has access to the private key will possess the funds.

    They only digitally exist on the blockchain, being associated with a set of
    “public/private keys”.If you don’t own your “private key”, then you don’t
    own your crypto assets, since you can’t unlock or manage them.

    When you leave your crypto on an exchange, it’s actually the exchange that
    effectively owns the private keys associated with your funds. As a result,
    the exchange is in control. You are just relying on them to give you access
    to your funds when you demand it.

    While being different, public and private keys are closely linked to each
    other in a way that creates 3 important operating rules:

    - One private key can generate several public keys (or receiving addresses)
    - Only the owner of the corresponding private key can access the info sent
      on the publicly available addresses
    - It’s possible to recover the public key if you own the private key.
      However it’s impossible to find the private key using only the public key

    Therefore, if you lose your private key, you lose your funds. Similarly, if
    you don’t own your private keys, you don’t own your crypto.

    ![](/images/crypto-public-private-keys.png)

    </Solution>

18. What is wallet?

    <Solution>

    A crypto wallet is an interface that allows you to interact with the
    blockchain network and the assets you hold on it. When you create a crypto
    wallet, you automatically generate a set of public and private keys.

    Unlike the traditional wallets we use in our everyday lives to carry bills
    and coins, cryptocurrency wallets don’t really store your coins or tokens.
    They contain your private keys instead. Your funds are actually part of the
    blockchain as pieces of data, and wallets allow you to access them. Through
    your crypto wallet, you can generate your different public keys or
    addresses, which enable you to receive payments.

    </Solution>

19. What are two categories of crypto wallet?

    <Solution>

    Crypto wallets are divided into two categories: “hot” and “cold” wallets.
    Hot wallets are digital wallets that are easily accessible via mobile
    devices, laptops, and desktops. Those include crypto exchanges, online and
    software wallets.

    Through user-friendly interfaces, you can easily transfer and manage your
    crypto assets, which makes them very attractive for beginners. However, some
    of these wallets are operated by third-parties. Like with crypto exchanges,
    which means that they are in control of the private keys associated with
    your assets stored in the wallet.

    In addition, **hot wallets** are exposed to the Internet, making them
    appealing targets for hackers to subvert the security measures of the
    administering third-party and steal users’ funds. Moreover, if your computer
    or smartphone gets hacked, or if you lose them, your funds are at risk.

    A **cold wallet** refers to physical (usually small) objects, such as a
    hardware device, in which you can store your private key. Contrary to hot
    wallets, they operate in an offline environment while guaranteeing access to
    your funds at any time. As they are completely offline, cold wallets provide
    a greater level of security. However, they remain less convenient in terms
    of accessibility as you have to connect them before being able to manage
    your assets.

    ![](/images/hot-wallet-cold-wallet.png)

    </Solution>

20. Beyond the hot/cold dichotomie, you have subcategories of wallets. Describe
    the pros and cons for each of them.

    <Solution>

    There are different types of crypto wallets: software wallets, hardware
    wallets and paper wallets. While they serve the same function, they don’t
    provide you with the same levels of security and ownership, nor with the
    same features. Some are more prone to hacks, others are less intuitive yet
    highly secure. Some allow you to own your crypto, others don’t.

    **Exchange and Online Wallets**

    They are hot wallets accessible through websites. Both are easy for
    beginners as they offer convenience. However, they do not allow you to own
    your private keys, i.e. your crypto assets. And they are prone to hacks,
    online threats and virus attacks. Therefore, they have a lower level of
    security and limit your freedom.

    **Software Wallets**

    They are hot wallets accessible through a dedicated desktop or mobile app.
    While being safer than web wallets, they are under the threat of malwares
    and hacks.

    Hot wallets are highly popular for mobile users and conveniently transfer
    small amounts of cryptocurrencies. However, users should never store vast
    sums in hot wallets. Treat hot wallets as you would treat a physical wallet,
    where you only keep small sums of cash at a time.

    **Hardware Wallets**

    They are cold wallets and the most secure alternative so far. Hardware
    wallets are physical devices used for storing your private key in an
    encrypted, offline environment. Put simply, hardware wallets allow you to
    perform all your operations when connected to your computer or phone,
    without ever letting your private key “out”, on the Internet or on your
    device.

    Therefore, your private keys remain safe from online hacks or virus threats
    while managing or transferring your crypto assets. That’s why hardware
    wallets are not vulnerable to such cyberattacks, unlike exchanges and other
    hot wallets.

    By using a hardware wallet, you ensure ownership and full control over your
    assets as you are the only one in charge of your money and own your private
    keys. There is no third party involved.

    Users, exchanges, and projects all favor hardware wallets as their long-term
    storage solutions for cryptocurrency assets.

    **Paper Wallets**

    We could say that this is the old-school method: a piece of paper on which
    you write your private keys. Being totally offline, they are also very safe.
    But as you might guess, they are easy to lose and easy to damage. Thus, not
    convenient at all.

    </Solution>

21. The security level of a hardware wallet depends on the quality of protection
    layers. What are they?

    <Solution>

    Hardware wallets typically consist of three primary security features or
    layers:

    - A hardware (physical) component. Hardware wallets use a chip.
    - An operating system.
    - An anti-tampering authentication check.

    </Solution>

22. Why is Ledger Nano the safest wallet?

    <Solution>

    Every single one of our wallets components is the best on the market.

    **The Finest Chip**

    Most hardware wallet providers use generic chips (called Microcontroller
    chips). Those are used in common appliances like microwaves and TV remotes.

    But for the awesome responsibility of sercuring a hardware wallet, these
    chips are not up to the task, because they have a number of vulnerabilities
    – this leaves your most precious data wide open to hackers with technical
    knowhow.

    So at Ledger, we use a higher level of chip, designed specifically for
    sensitive data – it’s called secure element. Secure element chips are used
    in passports, credit cards and payment systems – essentially, anywhere that
    requires you to keep your data on a device while ensuring it stays hidden.
    With every Nano benefiting from a secure element chip, you can have peace of
    mind, knowing your funds will never be vulnerable to physical hacks.

    **The Finest Operating System**

    Operating systems are a critical feature of hardware wallets, and a
    component that deserves your attention.

    Off-the-shelf operating systems could have security flaws as they are not
    explicitly tailored towards protecting crypto assets. Additionally, hardware
    wallet services are rapidly adding support for more crypto assets, including
    intuitive interfaces and Bluetooth compatibility that are difficult to
    reconcile with conventional operating systems.

    Therefore, “tailor-made” operating systems are to be favoured when making
    the choice, and Ledger uses exactly that. Our bespoke BOLOS operating system
    is designed to allow your Ledger Nano to constantly update and integrate new
    features, allowing all the different elements of the wallet to integrate
    your key data without ever _revealing_ it to any of the applications.
    Agility with total security – this is why our custom operating system puts
    us ahead of the other options.

    </Solution>

23. Describe the extra features of Ledger Nano.

    <Solution>

    **Crypto Support**

    When it comes down to extra features, the first thing you should check is if
    the hardware wallet supports the cryptocurrencies you’re interested in.
    Expanding the suite of supported crypto assets while maintaining the same
    security standards has been one of the main development focuses for wallet
    providers. For instance, Ledger hardware wallets support over 1500 different
    cryptocurrencies.

    **Ease of Use**

    Beyond coverage, there are other features that can be attractive to users,
    like bluetooth connection, increased storage capacity etc.

    Our hardware wallets provide you with easy access to crypto management
    services thanks to one-single app: Ledger Live. This one-stop-shop offers
    you the possibility to directly buy, sell, lend or swap crypto assets thanks
    to our different partners, while keeping your private keys secure in your
    hardware wallet.

    </Solution>

24. Explain the Ledger ecosystem.

    <Solution>

    The ecosystem is composed of the combination of Ledger hardware wallets and
    the Ledger Live application for the goal of securing your funds while
    remaining in control.

    **Simplicity and Security**

    Ledger Live is our ecosystem of services and apps for crypto asstes, all of
    which have been fully integrated to work seamlessly with the Ledger Nano.
    Apps that have been integrated within our system benefit from Ledger Live’s
    simple and intuitive interface and straightforward transactions that keep
    your private keys hidden at all times.

    **Blind Signing - No Longer a Threat**

    Accessing your favourite DeFi and NFT services via Ledger Live has another
    key advantage over accessing them externally – your transactions are
    absolutely transparent. Because Ledger Live integrations are fully
    synthesized to work with the Nano, the device will automatically display
    full details of every transaction you make, overcoming a key vulnerability
    within the crypto industry known as **blind signing**.

    Ledger Live automatically comes with every Nano wallet purchased. They are
    like two sides of the same coin. For instance, for each action you want to
    operate, you need both Ledger Live, as well as your Nano wallet to verify
    and confirm the same transaction, it is quite similar to 2FA mechanisms.

    </Solution>

25. Why is Ledger Nano so secure?

    <Solution>

    The devices are designed so that your private keys never leave the security
    of the hardware, even when connecting your wallet to your smartphone or
    desktop.

    At Ledger, we are pioneering hardware wallet technology that provides
    unprecedented levels of security for crypto assets. How? By creating
    certified devices that are secure by design.

    - All of our Nano hardware wallets possess a certified chip, designed to
      withstand sophisticated attacks. They are called Secure Element (SE), and
      are cryptographically protected, similar to the ones used in the likes of
      passports and SIM cards. Unlike the generic chips used in remote controls
      or microwaves, your private keys stay safe and isolated inside the Secure
      Element chips.
    - Besides, Ledger Nano wallets are the only hardware wallets to have their
      own custom OS – called BOLOS. One designed specifically to protect your
      crypto assets. Not your family pictures. A tailor-made OS provides you
      with an enhanced security.
    - Ledger Nano wallets are the first and only certified hardware wallets on
      the market, certified by ANSSI, the French independent cyber security
      agency.

    Every hardware wallet comes with an authentication process. One that
    commonly operates at two different levels: the PIN number and the Recovery
    phrase.

    When setting up a new Nano device, you are asked to choose a PIN code. This
    code allows you to unlock your device.

    You may have already heard about that one. Whether it’s called Recovery
    Phrase, Seed Phrase, 24 Words, it’s all the same. Your 24-word recovery
    phrase is the only backup to your private keys.

    While your PIN code is unique to your physical device, your Recovery phrase
    is directly linked to your private key, therefore to your funds. It remains
    the same even when you switch to another device. And if discovered by
    anyone, it would give them access to your funds.

    Your recovery phrase is a unique sequence of 24 words, randomly generated by
    your hardware wallet during initialization This is the only time they are
    displayed and they are the only backup to your funds. Since no third parties
    are involved, there is no other backup. You are the only one in charge of
    your money.

    For example, if you forget your PIN code or lose your device, your 24 words
    allow you to regain access to your funds via your backup Ledger hardware
    wallet or simply any other wallet.

    How? When your 24 words are displayed on your device screen, you must
    carefully write down (in the correct order and without any misspellings)
    your 24 words. Then safeguard them after you initialize your hardware
    wallet. To help you do that, every Ledger hardware wallet comes with a
    Recovery Sheet: a physical card specifically designed to store your 24
    words. Please review the best practices to protect your recovery phrase and
    sheet, and carefully follow them. Once again, it is your responsibility.

    </Solution>

26. What is Ledger Live?

    <Solution>

    Ledger Live is our platform of apps and services integrated specifically to
    work with your Nano device. It functions as a secure gateway to the crypto
    ecosystem. This means accessing a variety of crypto, NFT and DeFi based
    services directly and seamlessly from your hardware wallet – a better,
    simpler user experience that bypasses a major security concern known as
    blind signing.

    The Ledger Live platform comes with every purchase of a Nano and can be
    installed directly on your smartphone or desktop. Using Ledger Live allows
    you to easily:

    - Buy your first digital assets through our partners, such as Bitcoin,
      Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Dash... and more...
    - Swap one crypto for another with our partners. Offering you the fastest
      way to swap coins and tokens in one single place to help you diversify
      your portfolio
    - Cash out and sell your digital assets whenever you want through our
      partners. Because you are the one who decides. No one else.
    - Grow your assets while keeping them safe. And Ledger Live offers you more
      than one way to do it. First choose your favorite crypto among the ones
      supported. Then choose your way:
      - Start growing them using our staking feature. Basically, staking works
        like investment accounts as it allows you to earn crypto rewards while
        keeping your assets secure in your hardware wallet. This option is only
        available on some specific blockchains which use a Proof-of-Stake
        protocol.

    Check your balance anytime and anywhere using the app, so that you can
    easily keep track of your crypto operations and check your real-time
    balance.

## Blockchain in Action

1. What a transaction recorded on a blockchain contains?

   <Solution>

   A _transaction_ recorded on a blockchain contains a peer-to-peer message that
   specifies the operations executed, data parameters used for the execution of
   operations, the sender and receiver of the message, the transaction fee, and
   the timestamp of its recording.

   </Solution>

2. What is a _blockchain_?

   <Solution>

   A _blockchain_ is a technology for enabling trust in a decentralized system
   of transacting peer participants. The purpose of a blockchain is to verify
   and validate (or reject, if not valid) a transaction initiated by a
   participant, and then execute the transaction and record the proof of these
   actions with the consensus of the peer participants. Blockchain
   infrastructure contains software for a specific purpose: trust intermediation
   among a large number of (typically unknown) peer-to-peer participants.

   </Solution>

3. Draw a schema to explain the blockchain stacks for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

   <Solution>

   Bitcoin has only the wallet application, whereas Ethereum features
   programmable code called _smart contracts_.

   ![](/images/bitcoin-and-ethereum.png)

   There are three levels of programming:

   - _Protocol-level programming_—This level involves software that is needed
     for the deployment and operation of the blockchain itself. This software is
     similar to your operating system or networking software. If you are a
     systems programmer and administrator, you’ll program at this level.
   - _Smart contract-level programming_—One level above is smart contract (or
     rules engine) programming. It is at this level that you design and program
     the rules for verification and validation, and specify the data and
     messages that are to be recorded on the underlying blockchain. The smart
     contract is the engine that drives the blockchain on behalf of the user
     application.
   - _Application-level programming_—This level involves programming using web
     (or enterprise or mobile) application frameworks and user interface design
     concepts that are outside the blockchain protocol.

   </Solution>

4. What are Dapps?

   <Solution>

   _Dapps_ are web or enterprise applications that include application logic to
   invoke blockchain functions that implement trust intermediation.

   Dapps embed a significant code element—that of smart contracts. For any given
   smart contract, an exact copy of the smart contract’s code is transmitted
   through a special transaction and deployed in the participant nodes of a
   blockchain network.

   </Solution>

5. What is a smart contract?

   <Solution>

   A _smart contract_ is an immutable executable code representing the logic of
   a Dapp. The data variables and functions defined in a smart contract
   collectively represent the state and operations for enforcing an
   application’s (Dapp’s) rules for verification, validation, and recording on
   the blockchain.

   </Solution>

6. What are the four key roles fulfilled by a blockchain?

   <Solution>

   - _Decentralized infrastructure_—Special computing hardware and software
     stacks support the blockchain protocol, smart contracts, and applications
     (Dapps). The main components of this infrastructure are the computing nodes
     and networks connecting the nodes.
   - _Distributed ledger technology_—On top of the infrastructure is the ledger.
     Transactions and data are recorded simultaneously in all stakeholders’
     ledgers. The ledger is distributed because all the stakeholders record the
     same facts. It is immutable because each block is linked to the signature
     of the previous block, making it tamperproof.
   - _Disintermediation protocol_—Participants in a decentralized system follow
     the same blockchain protocol to connect and to communicate and transact
     with one another. The protocol is a set of rules for everyone to follow.
     Ethereum and Hyperledger, for example, are two different blockchain
     protocols.
   - _Trust enabler_—In a decentralized system of participants, there are no
     central authorities or intermediaries such as banks. You, therefore, need
     an infrastructure that implements the rules for governance, provenance,
     compliance, and the like automatically, without any intermediaries.
     Blockchain software assumes the role of a _trust enabler_.

   </Solution>

7. What is a decentralized system?

   <Solution>

   A _decentralized_ system is a type of distributed system in which

   - Participants communicate peer to peer.
   - Participants are in control of their assets, digital or otherwise (such as
     an audio file, a digital health record, or a piece of land).
   - Participants can join and leave the system as they wish.
   - Participants operate beyond the typical boundaries of trust (such as within
     a university or a country).
   - Decisions are made by the distributed participants, not by any central
     authority.
   - Intermediation is achieved by the use of automated software such as a
     blockchain.

   </Solution>

8. What is a node?

   <Solution>

   _Node_ is a collective name for blockchain software and the machine or
   hardware on which it is installed for the participant of a decentralized
   system.

   A node can support many accounts to represent the identities of peer
   participants in the decentralized network. A 256-bit number represents an
   account.

   ![](/images/blockchain-node-and-application-stack.png)

   A blockchain node hosts the elements represented by the stack. It serves as a
   foundation for your blockchain application development.

   A blockchain application typically connects a large number of participants
   through its network of nodes. Each node can host multiple accounts to
   identify the different customers it services. A node can also host more than
   one Dapp, such as one for a decentralized supply chain management system and
   another for a decentralized payment system.

   </Solution>

9. How a blockchain network of nodes is identified?

   <Solution>

   A network identifier identifies a blockchain network of nodes. Network ID #1,
   for example, is the main Ethereum public network; network ID #4 is a public
   network called Rinkeby, and so on. You’ll have to indicate the network by
   using its identifier while deploying your smart contract on the network. The
   participants on a given network will share a unified distributed ledger for
   recording their transaction details.

   </Solution>

10. Where smart contracts are deployed?

    <Solution>

    The smart contracts are deployed in a sandbox environment such as a virtual
    machine (VM) hosted by a blockchain node. The syntax of a smart contract is
    similar to a class in an OO (object-oriented) language. It contains data,
    functions, and rules for the execution of functions. Calling or invoking a
    smart contract function generates the transactions that are recorded on the
    blockchain. If any of the verification and validation rules fails, the
    function invocation is reverted. But if the execution is successful, the
    generated transactions (Txs) are broadcast to the network for recording. The
    figure below illustrates how a function call is transformed into actions
    that are recorded on the blockchain. The smart contract is deployed in a
    sandbox environment and identified by a 160-bit account address like any
    other participants on the blockchain network.

    ![](/images/smart-contract-mechanism.png)

    </Solution>

11. How transactions get recorded on the blockchain.

    <Solution>

    A set of transactions makes a block, and a set of blocks make a blockchain.
    The process is as follows:

    1. Transactions on the network are verified, gathered, and pooled. Nodes
       select a set of transactions from the pool to create a block.
    2. Participant nodes use a consensus algorithm to collectively agree or come
       to a consensus on a single consistent block of transactions to be
       appended to the existing chain.
    3. A hash or representative value of the current lead block of the chain is
       added to the newly appended block, creating a chain link.

    A blockchain is an _append-only_ distributed immutable ledger. Its creation
    begins with a single block called the _genesis block_. Every node of a
    stakeholder on the blockchain has an identical copy of the blockchain,
    starting with the genesis node. A blockchain DLT, therefore, is

    - _Distributed_, because the blockchain protocol ensures that every
      distributed node involved has an identical copy of the chain of blocks.
    - _Immutable_, because each newly created block is linked to the existing
      blockchain by the hash value of the current head of the blockchain.

    </Solution>

12. How trust intermediation is achieved?

    <Solution>

    In a decentralized system, trust intermediation is achieved by the
    decentralized infrastructure, the DLT, and the disintermediation protocol.

    </Solution>

13. What the first four recommended design principles before deploying a smart
    contract?

    <Solution>

    **DESIGN PRINCIPLE 1:** Design before you code, develop, and deploy a smart
    contract on a test chain, and thoroughly test it before you deploy it on a
    production blockchain, because when the smart contract is deployed, it is
    immutable.

    **DESIGN PRINCIPLE 2:** Define the users of and use cases for the system.
    Users are entities that generate the actions and the input and receive the
    output from the system you’ll be designing.

    **DESIGN PRINCIPLE 3:** Define the data assets, peer participants and their
    roles, rules to be enforced, and transactions to be recorded for the system
    you’ll be designing.

    **DESIGN PRINCIPLE 4:** Define a contract diagram that specifies the name,
    data assets, functions, and rules for execution of functions and access to
    the data.

    </Solution>

14. Which component distinguishes a smart contract diagram from a traditional
    class diagram?

    <Solution>

    The smart contract diagram has one additional component: the rules for
    accessing the functions and data.

    </Solution>

15. Apply these design principles in your decentralized counter application.

    <Solution>

    **DP 1 & 2**

    ![](/images/counter-use-case-diagram.png)

    **DP 3**

    - _Data assets to track_—The value of the counter
    - _Peer participants_—The applications that update the counter value
    - _Roles of these participants_—Updating the counter value and accessing its
      value
    - _Rules to be verified and validated, to be applied to data and
      functions_—None in this use case
    - _Transactions to be recorded in the digital ledger_—`initialize()`,
      `increment()`, and `decrement()`

    The `get()` function is to view the contents of the counter, and you may not
    want its invocation recorded on the blockchain. You can specify this
    characteristic by defining it as a _view-only_ function. The transactions of
    view functions are not recorded on the blockchain.

    **DP 4**

    ![](/images/counter-contract-diagram.png)

    The contract diagram includes a `constructor()` function and a `get()`
    function. The constructor, when invoked, deploys the smart contract code in
    the VM sandbox supported by the blockchain infrastructure. It also
    initializes the contract’s state if the constructor has any parameters. The
    `get()` function is a utility function that returns the current value of the
    counter. This function is a view function; no transaction is recorded when
    it is invoked.

    </Solution>

16. Deploy the Counter smart contract in a test environment. Interact with it.

    <Solution>

    ```solidity fp=Counter.sol nu
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract Counter {
      uint value;

      function initialize(unit x) public {
        value = x;
      }

      function get() view public returns (uint) {
        return value;
      }

      function increment(uint n) public {
        value = value + n;
      }

      function decrement(uint n) public {
        value = value - n;
      }
    }
    ```

    </Solution>

17. Describe some feature of a smart contract that make it "smart".

    <Solution>

    A smart contract is equivalent to any participant in a blockchain network
    because it has

    - A name
    - An address
    - A cryptocurrency balance
    - Built-in features to send and receive cryptocurrency
    - Data and functions
    - Built-in features to receive messages and invoke functions
    - The ability to reason out the execution of a function

    These aspects distinguish and set apart a smart contract from a regular
    piece of code.

    All the participants interacting with the blockchain, including a smart
    contract, have an account number or address that uniquely identifies them:

    - Ethereum supports two types of accounts: externally owned accounts (EOAs)
      and smart contract accounts. Both types of accounts are identified by
      addresses that are 160 bits, or 40 bytes, long.
    - Both types of accounts, EOAs and smart contracts, can hold a balance of
      ethers. Thus, every account has these two _implicit_ attributes: `address`
      and `balance`. You may not find these attributes explicitly declared in
      your smart contract; `address(this).balance` will get you the balance held
      in your smart contract.
    - An EOA or a smart contract account can invoke a smart contract function by
      sending a message. This message has two _implied_ attributes: `msg.sender`
      and `msg.value`. Yes, a message can carry a value that is added to the
      balance held by the smart contract when one of its functions is invoked.
      The function has to be declared with a payable modifier to be eligible to
      receive funds.

    </Solution>

18. Deploy the AccountsDemo smart contract in a test environment. Interact with
    it.

    <Solution>

    ```solidity fp=AccountsDemo.sol nu
    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

    contract AccountsDemo {
        address public whoDeposited;
        uint public depositAmt;
        uint public accountBalance;

        function deposit() public payable {
            whoDeposited = msg.sender;
            depositAmt = msg.value;
            accountBalance = msg.sender.balance;
        }
    }
    ```

    </Solution>
