## Bitcoin et cryptomonnaies pour les nuls

1. Quels sont les deux éléments clés d'une monnaie ?

   <Solution>

   - Un élément (pièce, billet, lingo d'or...) auquel nous avons convenu d'attribuer une certaine valeur.
   - Un tiers de confiance qui est le garant de la validité de cet élément d'échange.

   </Solution>

2. Expliquer le modèle défini par Satoshi Nakamoto dans lequel la confiance ne repose plus sur les banques.

   <Solution>

   Dans son modèle, la confiance repose sur :

   - un modèle mathématique sophistiqué : la cryptographie ;
   - nous-mêmes, usagers de la monnaie.

   La différence réside dans le mécanisme de confiance qui a initialement été développé et que l'on appelle la _blockchain_.

   </Solution>

3. Qu'est-ce qu'un système _peer-to-peer_ et comment ce type de système a-t-il inspiré la création du Bitcoin ?

   <Solution>

   Sur un système _peer to peer_, on dit que l'information est « décentralisée » ou « distribuée ». Bitcoin repose sur ce même principe d'informatique décentralisée. Chaque ordinateur connecté à un moment donné participe à la communauté globale. Il n'existe plus de banque et, donc, plus de serveur central. Les données relatives à vos bitcoins ne sont donc pas stockées par une entreprise unique, mais réparties entre plusieurs participants.

   Selon une même logique, le logiciel sur lequel repose Bitcoin est _open source_ ou « libre », ce qui signifie qu'il n'appartient à aucun éditeur. Ni Microsoft, ni Google, ni Sony ne sont propriétaires de Bitcoin ni des variantes qui ont pu suivre, comme Ethereum, Ripple ou EOS.

   Le logiciel qui gère une cryptomonnaie donnée est à la disposition de tous, et, mieux encore, chacun peut l'adapter à sa guise. Il en est de même pour les incroyables applications de la DeFi (finance décentralisée), qui sont en train de révolutionner les systèmes de l'épargne rémunérée et de l'assurance.

## Ledger

1. What the fundamental problem before the appearance of blockchain technology and Bitcoin.

   <Solution>

   Before, it was not possible to share value in a decentralized manner. If you want to share a file or a song with a friend, via WeTransfer or email for example, you actually send a copy of the file, and keep the original on your device. But if you send one dollar to a friend while keeping that same dollar, the dollar loses its value.

   The only way to exchange money was through intermediaries, whether they be digital or physical (there you are banks). So the million-dollar question was: _how to extend decentralization to the sharing of value?_ In other words, _how to create a digital currency that would allow peer-to-peer transactions?_

   The answer came up in 2008 with the birth of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. When its creator Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper called _Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System_. With this pretty descriptive title, it explains what Bitcoin is and how it works. By doing so, it had carved the path for the cryptocurrency ecosystem and market as well as a new way to share peer-to-peer value.

   </Solution>

2. How the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies fit together?

   <Solution>

   Put simply, while cryptocurrency is like digital money, blockchain is the network on which the money transactions operate.

   Knowing that, most cryptocurrencies have their own blockchains with their own rules. That’s why you have on one hand “the blockchain technology”: the generic technical concept, and on the other hand several “blockchains” which support the different cryptocurrencies, such as the “Bitcoin blockchain network” or “Ethereum Blockchain”.

   While blockchain is the supporting technology, cryptocurrency is so far the most common use of this technology.

   </Solution>

3. Give the differences and similarities between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

   <Solution>

   Both are mediums of exchange that can be used to store and transfer value, as well as to purchase goods and services. Both are legal. Both can be used for trading or investment. Both rely on widespread consumer trust to function as means of exchange. Both have their value governed by economic factors such as supply, demand, work and scarcity. However, there are 5 major critical differences. This is where the revolutionary power of crypto lies in.

   By cutting out the middlemen and disrupting the traditional financial system, crypto advocates decentralization and individual empowerment.

## Blockchain in Action

1. What a transaction recorded on a blockchain contains?

   <Solution>

   A _transaction_ recorded on a blockchain contains a peer-to-peer
   message that specifies the operations executed, data parameters used for the
   execution of operations, the sender and receiver of the message, the transaction
   fee, and the timestamp of its recording.

   </Solution>

2. What is a _blockchain_?

   <Solution>

   A _blockchain_ is a technology for enabling trust in a decentralized system of transacting
   peer participants. The purpose of a blockchain is to verify and validate (or reject, if
   not valid) a transaction initiated by a participant, and then execute the transaction
   and record the proof of these actions with the consensus of the peer participants. Blockchain infrastructure contains software for a specific purpose: trust intermediation
   among a large number of (typically unknown) peer-to-peer participants.

   </Solution>

3. Draw a schema to explain the blockchain stacks for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

   <Solution>

   Bitcoin has only the wallet application, whereas Ethereum features programmable code called _smart contracts_.

   ![](/images/bitcoin-and-ethereum.png)

   There are three levels of programming:

   - _Protocol-level programming_—This level involves software that is needed for the
     deployment and operation of the blockchain itself. This software is similar to
     your operating system or networking software. If you are a systems programmer
     and administrator, you’ll program at this level.
   - _Smart contract-level programming_—One level above is smart contract (or rules
     engine) programming. It is at this level that you design and program the rules
     for verification and validation, and specify the data and messages that are to be
     recorded on the underlying blockchain. The smart contract is the engine that
     drives the blockchain on behalf of the user application.
   - _Application-level programming_—This level involves programming using web (or
     enterprise or mobile) application frameworks and user interface design concepts
     that are outside the blockchain protocol.

   </Solution>

4. What are Dapps?

   <Solution>

   _Dapps_ are web or enterprise applications that include application
   logic to invoke blockchain functions that implement trust intermediation.

   Dapps embed a significant code element—that of smart contracts. For any given smart
   contract, an exact copy of the smart contract’s code is transmitted through a special
   transaction and deployed in the participant nodes of a blockchain network.

   </Solution>

5. What is a smart contract?

   <Solution>

   A _smart_ contract8 is an immutable executable code representing the
   logic of a Dapp. The data variables and functions defined in a smart contract
   collectively represent the state and operations for enforcing an application’s
   (Dapp’s) rules for verification, validation, and recording on the blockchain.

   </Solution>

6. What are the four key roles fulfilled by a blockchain?

   <Solution>

   - _Decentralized infrastructure_—Special computing hardware and software stacks
     support the blockchain protocol, smart contracts, and applications (Dapps).
     The main components of this infrastructure are the computing nodes and networks
     connecting the nodes.
   - _Distributed ledger technology_—On top of the infrastructure is the ledger. Transactions and data are recorded simultaneously in all stakeholders’ ledgers. The
     ledger is distributed because all the stakeholders record the same facts. It is
     immutable because each block is linked to the signature of the previous block,
     making it tamperproof.
   - _Disintermediation protocol_—Participants in a decentralized system follow the same
     blockchain protocol to connect and to communicate and transact with one
     another. The protocol is a set of rules for everyone to follow. Ethereum and
     Hyperledger, for example, are two different blockchain protocols.
   - _Trust enabler_—In a decentralized system of participants, there are no central
     authorities or intermediaries such as banks. You, therefore, need an infrastructure
     that implements the rules for governance, provenance, compliance, and
     the like automatically, without any intermediaries. Blockchain software assumes
     the role of a _trust enabler_.

   </Solution>

7. What is a decentralized system?

   <Solution>

   A _decentralized_ system is a type of distributed system in which

   - Participants communicate peer to peer.
   - Participants are in control of their assets, digital or otherwise (such as an audio
     file, a digital health record, or a piece of land).
   - Participants can join and leave the system as they wish.
   - Participants operate beyond the typical boundaries of trust (such as within a
     university or a country).
   - Decisions are made by the distributed participants, not by any central authority.
   - Intermediation is achieved by the use of automated software such as a blockchain.

   </Solution>

8. What is a node?

   <Solution>

   _Node_ is a collective name for blockchain software and the machine or hardware on which it is installed for the participant of a decentralized system.

   A node can support many accounts to represent the identities of peer participants in the decentralized
   network. A 256-bit number represents an account.

   ![](/images/blockchain-node-and-application-stack.png)

   A blockchain node hosts the elements represented by the stack. It serves
   as a foundation for your blockchain application development.

   A blockchain application typically connects a large number of participants
   through its network of nodes. Each node can host multiple accounts to identify the
   different customers it services. A node can also host more than one Dapp, such as one
   for a decentralized supply chain management system and another for a decentralized
   payment system.

   </Solution>

9. How a blockchain network of nodes is identified?

   <Solution>

   A network identifier identifies a blockchain network of nodes. Network ID #1, for
   example, is the main Ethereum public network; network ID #4 is a public network
   called Rinkeby, and so on. You’ll have to indicate the network
   by using its identifier while deploying your smart contract on the network. The
   participants on a given network will share a unified distributed ledger for recording
   their transaction details.

   </Solution>

10. Where smart contracts are deployed?

    <Solution>

    The smart contracts are deployed in a sandbox environment such as a virtual
    machine (VM) hosted by a blockchain node. The syntax of a smart contract is similar
    to a class in an OO (object-oriented) language. It contains data, functions, and rules
    for the execution of functions. Calling or invoking a smart contract function generates
    the transactions that are recorded on the blockchain. If
    any of the verification and validation rules fails, the function invocation is reverted.
    But if the execution is successful, the generated transactions (Txs) are broadcast to
    the network for recording. The figure below illustrates how a function
    call is transformed into actions that are recorded on the blockchain.
