1. What are 10 major system features that Docker uses to build containers?

   <Solution>

   - _PID namespace_—Process identifiers and capabilities
   - _UTS namespace_—Host and domain name
   - _MNT namespace_—Filesystem access and structure
   - _IPC namespace_—Process communication over shared memory
   - _NET namespace_—Network access and structure
   - _USR namespace_—User names and identifiers
   - _`chroot` syscall_—Controls the location of the filesystem root
   - _cgroups_—Resource protection
   - _CAP drop_—Operating system feature restrictions
   - _Security modules_—Mandatory access controls

   Docker uses those to build containers at runtime, but it uses another set of
   technologies to package and ship containers.

   </Solution>

2. How Docker completes the traditional container technology?

   <Solution>

   Docker completes the traditional container technology by including a way to
   package and distribute software. The component that fills the shipping
   container role is called an _image_.
